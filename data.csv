APW_ENG_19941111.0006,9/21/2006, <P> World championship leader Michael Schumacher escaped a high-speed crash unhurt Friday as former world champion Nigel Mansell grabbed provisional pole position for Sunday's Australian Grand Prix. </P> <P> Mansell who returned to Formula One racing from the IndyCar circuit last month covered the 3.78-kilometer (2.348-mile) Adelaide street circuit in his Williams-Renault in one minute 16.179 seconds an average speed of 178.631 kilometers (110.999 miles) per hour. </P> <P> He overhauled Schumacher with under four minutes of the first qualifying session remaining after spinning out minutes earlier while successfully avoiding colliding with the stalled car of Johnny Herbert. </P> <P> ``You have to have a sense of humor when you come round the corner full bore and see the track blocked '' said Mansell. ``That was a close moment.'' </P> <P> Schumacher was second-fastest in his Benetton-Ford at 1:16.197 -- just 0.018 second slower -- and walked away unharmed from a spectacular crash in the dying seconds of the session. </P> <P> The German who at 25 is aiming to become the youngest world champion in almost 20 years lost control in a chicane hit a tire barrier and spun four times losing two wheels. He jumped out of the wreckage shaking his head in disgust but otherwise unfazed. </P> <P> Damon Hill Mansell's teammate and compatriot and Schumacher's only rival for the world title was third-quickest at 1:16.830 in the other Williams-Renault. </P> <P> Mika Hakkinen of Finland was fourth-fastest in a McLaren-Peugeot at 1:16.992 and then came Rubens Barrichello of Brazil in a Jordan-Hart at 1:17.537 and Eddie Irvine of Britain in a Jordan-Hart at 1:17.667. </P> <P> The final qualifying session is Saturday. </P> <P> Schumacher leads the drivers' championship with 92 points going into the season-ending race. Hill has 91. If either wins on Sunday that will clinch the title. </P> <P> Hill's victory in last week's Japanese Grand Prix left the him needing to score two more points than his German rival on Sunday. A victory is worth 10 points with the next five places worth 6 4 3 2 and 1 points. </P> <P> A one-point margin would leave the pair tied and would give Schumacher the title on the basis of his superior number of wins. </P> <P> Schumacher has won eight races this season and Hill six. The showdown marks the second time in the 10-year history of the Adelaide race that the world championship will be decided in Australia. </P> <P> Schumacher leads despite being suspended from two races for ignoring a black flag during the July 10 British Grand Prix. He triumphed in six of the first seven races of the 16-race season. </P> <P> The German has vowed to be aggressive but appears relaxed. </P> <P> ``In past races if I made a mistake I could always think about doing better next time '' he said. ``Now there is no next time. I can't afford to wait behind Damon and see what happens.'' </P> <P> Hill the 34-year-old son of the late two-time world champion Graham Hill took over as No. 1 driver for the Williams-Renault team after three-time world champion Ayrton Senna was killed in a crash at the San Marino Grand Prix in May. </P> <P> Hill has won four of the last five grand prix and is aiming to become the first son of a world champion to take the drivers' title. Former Beatle George Harrison visited Hill in the pits Friday to wish him luck. </P> <P> ``I think we have learned a lot today and with a bit of work tonight we will be able to put that information to good use for final qualifying '' said Hill. ``It is good news that Nigel who is being very helpful is faster than Michael.'' </P> <P> Mansell has twice started the Australian Grand Prix from pole position -- in 1986 and 1992 -- but never has won the race. </P> <P> ``I was very very happy today '' he said. </P> <P> The constructors' championship also will be decided in Adelaide. Williams-Renault currently has 108 points to Benetton-Ford's 103. </P>,Finland,Brazil; Australia,0.300000012,0.300000012,0.00132541,

APW_ENG_19941111.0010,12/10/2005, <P> Hoping to increase prosperity at home President Clinton is reaching out to the ``young vigorous'' economies of Asia to expand trade ties that he says offer untapped potential for growth. </P> <P> Still getting over jet lag from his last round of travel Clinton departs Friday for the Philippines and Indonesia where he will attend the second annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit with 17 world leaders. </P> <P> Clinton referring to his Democratic Party's devastating election losses acknowledged Thursday that many Americans are insecure about their economic future and wary of expanding global trade. </P> <P> ``For too many of our people trade still appears to be a gale force wind just another threat ready to blow away the prospects of a stable job at a good wage just another problem adding to the already unstable uncertain condition of their lives '' he told an audience at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. </P> <P> But the president argued that expanding U.S. trade with Asia and other nations would serve to strengthen the nation's economic position saying ``the young vigorous economies of Asia and the Western Hemisphere offer enormous untapped potential for our people to prosper.'' </P> <P> Already he said one-third of U.S. exports go to the Pacific Rim and Asian markets have created more than 2 million American jobs. </P> <P> Clinton was host for the first APEC summit last year in Seattle where leaders endorsed the principle of free trade without specifics. The goal this year is to create a free-trade zone among the nations by some date in the 21st century. </P> <P> ``Next week we'll move from a common vision to a common direction '' Clinton said. ``We'll work to set concrete goals to open the way for doing business in Asia taking down tariff walls eliminating non-tariff barriers simplifying procedures and standards to smooth the flow of goods.'' </P> <P> He said it was a demonstration of his commitment to expanding trade that he was traveling to Indonesia when he is still ``a little bit jet-lagged'' from his recent trip to the Middle East and a flurry of campaign travel. </P> <P> He said he wanted to dispel any misimpression among Asians who ``wonder whether we're ready to withdraw from the region'' because of stiff economic competition. ``Nothing could be further from the truth '' he said. </P> <P> The president pledged to raise concerns about human rights abuses in the region during his visit saying ``I don't think we have to choose between increasing trade and fostering human rights and open societies.'' </P> <P> ``I will do everything I can to be frank in terms of our differences as well as our potential partnerships with the Chinese with the Indonesians and with others '' Clinton said. </P> <P> In Indonesia President Suharto has fostered rapid economic development but critics fault the authoritarian nature of his government. Washington has warned that trade privileges could be stopped unless the rights of the country's workers are recognized. </P> <P> Amnesty International USA welcomed Clinton's ``recognition of the importance of human rights in trade discussions '' but said it regretted his ``failure to express his objection to the gross abuses carried out by the Indonesian government in the run-up to the APEC summit.'' </P> <P> ``President Clinton must now transform his stated commitment to human rights into specific recommendations for improving the human rights in the APEC member countries '' the organization's executive director William F. Schulz said in a statement. </P> <P> Clinton presented his trip to Asia as one of three ``crucial building blocks'' on trade that he will pursue in the next month. He challenged the lame-duck Congress to approve a 123-nation trade agreement and pledged to promote expanded trade with Latin America at a December summit in Miami. </P> <P> On his way to Indonesia Clinton will stop in the Philippines for a two-day visit. </P>,Philippines,Indonesia,0.100000001,0.034006331, , 
APW_ENG_19941111.0021,5/19/2005, <P> President Kim Young-sam of South Korea predicted Friday that North Korea will one day welcome direct trade with his nation even though it is now rejecting it. </P> <P> Last week Kim lifted a half-century ban on direct investment and trade with North Korea and South Korean businessmen welcomed the move saying it would quickly benefit both countries. </P> <P> But North Korea -- an isolated hard-line Communist country -- has officially rejected the breakthrough. Pyongyang said it doesn't want to do business with its capitalist archenemy. </P> <P> That response didn't bewilder Kim who is on a three-day official visit to the Philippines or leave him pessimistic. </P> <P> ``It is not very surprising that North Korea refused to accept our offer '' he said at a news conference. Acceptance would amount to recognizing South Korea's sovereignty but the North regards South Korea as a colony of the United States. </P> <P> ``North Korea knows very well that it is only the Republic of (South) Korea that can provide it with substantial help. ... We will continue to offer such ideas and options '' Kim said. </P> <P> North Korea does little to discourage indirect trade between the North and South through a third country. That business soared to dlrs 232 million in the first eight months of 1994 from dlrs 1 million in 1983 -- despite the two countries' nuclear dispute. </P> <P> Pyongyang also has been contacting South Korean businessmen in Beijing to discuss investment and inviting conglomerates in the South to visit North Korea to talk about trade. </P> <P> Last month the United States and North Korea signed an accord that will freeze the North's nuclear program -- which may have been building nuclear bombs -- and eventually open it to inspection. </P> <P> In return Pyongyang will receive billions of dollars in financial aid much of it provided by South Korea and diplomatic relations with the United States. </P> <P> Kim whose visit to the Philippines ends Saturday met with President Fidel Ramos Friday to discuss regional and bilateral issues such as trade and investment. Although the United States remains the Philippine's largest trading partner investment is pouring in from South Korea Taiwan and Japan. </P> <P> Kim said Ramos promised to support South Korea's bid for non-permanent membership in the U.N. Security Council and director-generalship of the World Trade Organization. </P> <P> ``Our two nations have become close neighbors and we are now set to march forward together for the peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region '' Kim said at the news conference which he held along with Ramos at Malacanang Palace in Manila. </P> <P> Kim also thanked Ramos for promising to give priority to Korean banks that want to open branches in the Philippines. </P>,Philippines,Japan,0.005947951, , ,

APW_ENG_19941111.0049,9/9/2006, <P> U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher made sweeping proposals Friday to build electronic bridges across the Pacific and help Asia solve its crushing infrastructure problems. </P> <P> Christopher addressing a closed meeting of foreign ministers of the 18-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum painted a vivid portrait of an electronic and trading revolution that is already drawing the Americas and Asia closer and said the transformation should be speeded up. </P> <P> ``We live in a time when a company in Jakarta can start with capital from Hong Kong and New York make a product designed in Osaka or Seattle with parts from Pusan and Detroit market and advertise that product with firms based in Singapore and Los Angeles and sell it all over the world '' he said. </P> <P> But that company like the global economy ``cannot thrive if we permit trade barriers to drive a wedge between supply and demand '' he said alluding to frictions between the United States and its partners over an investment code worked out Thursday by APEC officials. </P> <P> Washington feels the non-binding code is too timid about obliging APEC states to bring down barriers to foreign investment. </P> <P> But others including China say APEC should recognize the different levels of economic development of its members to ensure the poorer ones don't lose out if barriers fall progressively faster. </P> <P> ``We know there are sharp contrasts among our economic structures and our political systems. But we also know that increasingly open trade is making each of our economies grow '' Christopher said. </P> <P> Five-year-old APEC remains a consultative body which makes decisions by consensus and some diplomatic observers say trade liberalization could be blocked by members who oppose setting a timetable for removing barriers. </P> <P> The foreign ministers were meeting ahead of an APEC summit next week to be attended by President Clinton. The meeting is designed to steer the hopeful rhetoric at last year's summit in Seattle toward reality. </P> <P> Clinton Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and Chinese President Jiang Zemin are among those due to meet Tuesday at a presidential retreat in Bogor 40 miles (60 kilometers) from Jakarta. </P> <P> Christopher offered three proposals to promote harmony ``across the ocean of opportunity that is the Pacific:'' -- a meeting of APEC transport ministers in the United States ``to address this region's massive infrastructure demands.'' Asia's rapid economic growth has left it critically short of roads airports seaport container space and railroads. -- a privately funded education foundation to set up ``an APEC-wide multimedia telecommunications network linked by telephones computers and video.'' </P> <P> ``Scholars in Singapore could collaborate more easily with colleagues in Chile. Mexican graduate students could hold video-teleconferences with Chinese peers '' he said. -- a forum to help small businessmen. </P> <P> Christopher said adoption of the proposals would ease transport bottlenecks broaden educational opportunities and create a climate in which ``business people are comfortable in Kansas City and Kuala Lumpur.'' </P> <P> Christopher said he was sure Congress would ratify the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs the world's main trade liberalization accord despite the opposition Republican seizure of the legislature in this week's U.S. elections. </P> <P> Opening Friday's meeting in Jakarta's ornate Convention Center Indonesian president Suharto said the APEC summit should seek basic agreement on liberalizing trade and investment. </P> <P> He said he hoped the summit ``will produce a basic agreement on the cooperation among APEC members that will accelerate trade liberalization and investment among us.'' </P> <P> If carried out the trade liberalization proposals could result in the most open trading area in the world by 2020. </P> <P> APEC has a combined population of 2.2 billion gross output of dlrs 12 trillion and accounts for 41 percent of world trade. </P> <P> APEC shuns the idea of a trade bloc in favor of trying to reduce barriers to investment and commerce in goods and services among members. </P> <P> ``We have never designed APEC to evolve as an exclusive and closed trading bloc '' Suharto said. </P> <P> APEC consists of Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines Thailand Singapore Brunei the United States Japan China Australia Canada South Korea New Zealand Mexico Hong Kong Taiwan and Papua New Guinea. </P>,Singapore,Uruguay; Guinea; Philippines; Japan; Malaysia; Thailand; Canada; China; Mexico; Chile; Australia; Indonesia,0.002659688, , ,

APW_ENG_19941111.0071,12/5/2005, <P> He's back. Former world champion Nigel Mansell </P> <P> Friday grabbed provisional pole position for Sunday's Australian Grand Prix just a month after switching from the IndyCar series. </P> <P> World championship leader Michael Schumacher escaped unscathed from a spectacular high-speed crash as he attempted to match Mansell's time of one minute 16.179 seconds around the 3.78-kilometer (2.348-mile) Adelaide street circuit. </P> <P> Mansell averaged 178.631 kilometers per hour (110.999 miles per hour) in his Williams-Renault. </P> <P> The 41-year-old British veteran overtook Schumacher with less than four minutes left in the first qualifying session having recovered his composure after spinning minutes earlier while avoiding a collision with the stalled car of Johnny Herbert. </P> <P> ``You have to have a sense of humor when you come round the corner full bore and see the track blocked '' said Mansell. ``That was a close moment and I was happy to be able to do a time after that.'' </P> <P> Schumacher was second-fastest in his Benetton-Ford at 1:16.197 -- just 0.018 of a second slower -- and said he felt no ill effects after his crash in </P> <P> the final seconds of the session as he attempted to improve on Mansell's time. </P> <P> The German lost control in a chicane hit a tire barrier and then spun four times losing two wheels and wrecking his car in the process. </P> <P> He said he had complained Wednesday about the chicane being dangerous. ``The officials made a little change but it is still not good enough '' he said. </P> <P> Damon Hill Mansell's teammate and compatriot and Schumacher's only rival </P> <P> for the world title was third-quickest at 1:16.830 in the other Williams-Renault. </P> <P> Mika Hakkinen of Finland was fourth-fastest in a McLaren-Peugeot at 1:16.992 Rubens Barrichello of Brazil was fifth in a Jordan-Hart at 1:17.537 and Eddie Irvine of Britain was sixth-fastest in a Jordan-Hart at 1:17.667. </P> <P> The final qualifying session was scheduled for Saturday afternoon. </P> <P> Schumacher leads the drivers' championship with 92 points going into the season-ending race. Hill has 91. Either would clinch the title with a win Sunday. </P> <P> Hill's victory in last week's Japanese Grand Prix left him needing to score two more points than his German rival on Sunday. A victory is worth 10 points with the next five places worth 6 4 3 2 and 1 points respectively. </P> <P> A one-point margin would leave the pair tied and would give Schumacher the title because of his larger number of wins. </P> <P> Schumacher who at 25 is aiming to become the youngest world champion in almost 20 years has won eight races this season. Hill has grabbed six. </P> <P> Schumacher's crash sent debris flying all over the track. </P> <P> ``I went up on the curb going into the chicane and the front of the car jumped away '' he said. ``I went onto the next curb and the car was sideways -- out of control.

There was no immediate word on casualties. </P> <P> Karachi a sprawling port city of at least 10 million people has become increasingly chaotic in recent months. Gun fights between political factions and the security forces have become almost daily events. </P> <P> The latest trouble began when Mansoor Ahmed Khan the deputy secretary general of the opposition Mohajir Quami Movement was gunned down Thursday night along with three family members while they were in their car. </P> <P> As news of the killings spread violence erupted throughout central and eastern Karachi strongholds of the MQM. </P> <P> Police said a total of 13 people were shot dead Thursday evening and four more were killed Friday. More than 50 people were injured over the same period. </P> <P> Police blamed the shootings on infighting between the two MQM factions which represent mohajirs or Muslims who migrated from India. </P> <P> Most of the victims were killed by snipers or in drive-by shootings. Both methods of attack have become common in Karachi where automatic weapons are readily available. </P> <P> More than 150 people have died in shootings over the past five weeks and many fear that the violence is spiraling out of control. </P> <P> The MQM is the dominant political force in Karachi but the rival factions battle each other when not fighting the security forces. Khan belonged to the smaller breakaway group known as MQM (Haqiqi). </P> <P> His funeral was held Friday and police cordoned off streets in his neighborhood in an attempt to prevent further bloodshed. </P> <P> Both MQM factions are bitterly opposed to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government saying that she discriminates against the mohajirs.

APW_ENG_19941111.0161,11/23/2006, <P> Bosnian Serbs gave near-dictatorial powers to their hawkish leader today in the expectation he can reverse their recent battlefield losses. </P> <P> Reports from the northwest Bosnian front seemed to bear out Serb determination to strike back hard at Muslim-led government forces and their Croat allies. </P> <P> The Bosnian government meanwhile may soon get relief from the U.N. arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia. Washington announced Thursday that it plans to stop enforcing the ban against the outgunned government next week. </P> <P> The new fighting in the Bihac pocket coincided with the decision by the Bosnian Serb assembly to let their leader Radovan Karadzic act alone in waging the war instead of convening the assembly on important decisions. </P> <P> The assembly also gave Karadzic the power to declare martial law which would give him unchecked rights for instance to imprison draft evaders or confiscate their property. </P> <P> Karadzic who fell short of immediately proclaiming martial law said special military committees will immediately be formed in each district of Serb-held territory to govern along with civilian officials. Serbs hold 70 percent of Bosnia. </P> <P> The Bosnian Serb leader had pushed for more power in recent weeks as government forces sometimes supported by Bosnian Croat militias captured hundreds of miles of Serb-held territory. </P> <P> Karadzic had warned that Bosnian Serbs would destroy government army formations around Bihac. </P> <P> Serb military officials said government soldiers were on the run in the Bihac pocket sandwiched between Bosnian Serb units moving over the Una River from the south and rebel Serb forces in neighboring Croatia to the north. </P> <P> Bosnian radio reported fierce fighting in the region saying more than 2 000 explosions rocked the town of Bihac. </P> <P> ``They have been pulverizing Bihac and its outskirts '' said the report late Thursday. It said Serb shelling of the towns of Cazin Buzim Velika Kladusa and Bosanska Krupa had killed and wounded an unspecified number of civilians. </P> <P> The Serbs also were launching infantry attacks on almost all sections of the Bihac front the broadcast said. </P> <P> A U.N. official in Zagreb Croatia described the situation in the region as ``extremely unstable'' and the level of shelling as ``extremely high.'' Speaking on condition of anonymity he reported increased infantry fighting and said Serb claims their troops have advanced north over the Una appeared true. </P> <P> The loss of the Bihac pocket would be devastating for the government army which overtook most of the region in August. Its fall would give the Serbs another piece of territory to connect rebel Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia with Serbia proper. </P> <P> Government troops meanwhile claimed further gains Thursday saying they moved closer to Serb-held Teslic and Doboj in northern Bosnia. There was no confirmation from Bosnian Serb military sources. </P> <P> Bosnian Serbs launched the war in April 1992 after Muslims and Croats voted to secede from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia and Karadzic has rejected international pressures to make peace. </P> <P> The U.N. command meanwhile accused the Muslim-led government of firing on its own territory in the capital Sarajevo apparently to provoke a NATO air strike against the Bosnian Serbs. There was no immediate government comment. </P> <P> The surge in fighting has heightened tensions throughout the country including Sarajevo where artillery and sniper fire are increasing. </P> <P> The Bosnian Serb assembly met Wednesday and Thursday before giving Karadzic his wide-ranging powers early today. The long closed-door debate reflected the reluctance of some Bosnian Serb politicians to give Karadzic so much power and move the Serbs further away from peace. </P> <P> The Bosnian Serbs who have enjoyed weapons superiority are now believed to be running short of fuel. They are also outnumbered more than 2-to-1 by combined government-Croat forces and morale is said to be low after they lost ground in a war they thought they had already won. </P> <P> Serbia the largest republic in Yugoslavia halted supplies to the Bosnian Serbs in August to pressure them to accept an international peace plan they have repeatedly rejected. </P> <P> Under the plan Serbs would be forced to relinquish about one-third of the more than 70 percent of the republic they hold. </P> <P> American officials maintain a 1991 U.N. arms embargo prohibiting sales to all sides in the Balkan conflict has placed the Muslims at a disadvantage. </P> <P> Last month President Clinton signed a bill that would cut funding to enforce the embargo on Tuesday -- unless the United Nations lifts the ban first. </P> <P> A U.S.-sponsored resolution would exempt Bosnia's government from the embargo within six months if the Bosnian Serbs don't sign the peace treaty. </P> <P> NATO is in charge of enforcing the arms embargo.

A runoff would be required if no candidate received more than 50 percent. </P> <P> In voting for a 250-seat parliament Chissano's Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) received 50 percent of the votes compared to 33 percent for Dhlakama's Mozambique Resistance Movement (RENAMO) and 5 percent for the Democratic Union a coalition that appeared to benefit from voter confusion over its place on the ballot. </P> <P> The Democratic Union held the bottom spot on the parliamentary ballot while Chissano held the last place on the presidential ballot. Some voters apparently thought marking the final spot on both ballots would support Chissano and FRELIMO. </P> <P> The results which must still be double-checked by election officials represented 42 percent of the almost 6 million votes cast in the Oct. 27-29 balloting considered the southeast African nation's best chance to leave behind a legacy of war dating back almost to independence from Portugal in 1975. </P> <P> Ballot-counting has been slow due to poor communications in Mozambique and the election commission said Thursday it would fail to meet the Nov. 15 deadline for issuing a final result. </P> <P> Checking the validity of up to 500 000 votes delayed the counting indefinitely commission chairman Brazao Mazula said. </P> <P> Dhlakama has threatened to reject the results because of alleged fraud even though international observers said they believed the voting was free and fair. </P> <P> A South African government official who held talks this week in Mozambique said Thursday he believed the RENAMO leader would accept the result. </P> <P> ``We were assured by both (Chissano) and Mr. Dhlakama that they were going to accept the results of this election '' Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi told a news conference. </P> <P> The vote came two years after FRELIMO and RENAMO signed a treaty to end the war that killed 600 000 people and devastated the southeast African nation leaving it dependent on foreign money for most of its budget. </P>,Mozambique,Portugal,0.020248432, , ,

He warned the pilot that he had hidden a bomb aboard the plane officials said after the pilot issued a hijack alert over Yugoslavia. </P> <P> The plane landed at Salonica in northern Greece its scheduled stop where the other 68 passengers and all eight crew members left the plane. The pilot locked Tsenekides in the cockpit where he was arrested by anti-terrorism squad officers. No explosives were found on the plane. </P> <P> Doctors at a Salonica hospital later extracted a small crucifix that was lodged in Tsenekides' throat. </P> <P> His lawyer Lazaros Kyrizoglou told reporters that the whole incident was caused because the pilot did not believe his client's story about the crucifix and that Tsenekides had thought up the bomb warning so as to get prompt medical attention. </P> <P> ``He swallowed his cross by mistake at takeoff. He was filled with anxiety and as the flight went on his anxiety kept growing '' Kyrizoglou said. </P> <P> Tsenekides was charged Wednesday with hijacking endangering the safety of a flight and illegal possession of a weapon (after a pocket knife was found in his suitcase in the plane's cargo hold). </P> <P> On Tuesday police and airport officials had hinted that Tsenekides was carrying out a prank because he was disappointed by a failed love affair.

APW_ENG_19941111.0209,3/22/2004, <P> European officials expressed deep concern Friday that the United States might split the transAtlantic alliance by halting enforcement of the arms embargo against the Bosnian government. </P> <P> British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called the U.S. decision to stop enforcing the embargo next week despite opposition in the U.N. Security Council ``a worrying problem.'' </P> <P> He said he sympathized with President Clinton who has been under pressure from the U.S. Congress to lift the embargo but maintained that the embargo was ``a mandatory resolution of the Security Council and an agreed policy of the alliance.'' </P> <P> ``I hope very much it can be worked out by the Americans with their allies in a way which keeps us together '' Hurd said on BBC Radio 4's Today program. </P> <P> At present the arms embargo and an economic embargo are enforced by a joint NATO-Western European Union naval task force of 19 ships from 11 countries. They are supported by maritime patrol aircraft. </P> <P> The arms embargo was imposed in 1991 against all parties in the conflict as Yugoslavia disintegrated and fighting began in Slovenia and Croatia. American officials maintain the embargo has placed the Muslims at a disadvantage against the Bosnian Serbs. </P> <P> President Clinton signed a bill last month that would cut funding to enforce the embargo against the Muslim-led government on Nov. 15 -- Tuesday -- unless the United Nations lifted the ban first. </P> <P> A U.S.-sponsored resolution to lift the embargo completely is pending before the U.N. Security Council. </P> <P> European nations are concerned that if the embargo is lifted the Bosnian Serbs might attack U.N. peacekeepers.

APW_ENG_19941111.0210,4/18/2006, <P> Bosnian Serbs gave near-dictatorial powers to their hawkish leader today in the expectation he can reverse their recent battlefield losses. </P> <P> Reports of fierce fighting in Bihac in the north seemed to bear out Serb determination to strike back hard on the battlefield. </P> <P> The Bosnian government may soon get relief from the U.N. arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia. Washington announced Thursday that it plans to stop enforcing the ban against the outgunned government next week. </P> <P> Washington's action probably won't have much immediate impact on the battlefield but it could cause a rift with Britain and France which are afraid it would endanger their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia and Russia which has strong ethnic ties to the Serbs. Russian lawmakers today denounced the decision. </P> <P> The new fighting in the Bihac pocket coincided with the decision by the Bosnian Serb assembly to let their leader Radovan Karadzic act alone in waging the war instead of convening the assembly on important decisions. </P> <P> The assembly also gave Karadzic the power to declare martial law which would give him unchecked rights for instance to imprison draft evaders or confiscate their property. </P> <P> Karadzic said special military committees will immediately be formed in each district of Serb-held territory to govern along with civilian officials. Serbs hold 70 percent of Bosnia. </P> <P> The Bosnian Serb leader had pushed for more power in recent weeks as government forces sometimes supported by Bosnian Croat militias captured hundreds of miles of Serb-held territory. </P> <P> Karadzic had warned that Bosnian Serbs would destroy government army formations around Bihac. </P> <P> Serb military officials said government soldiers were on the run in the Bihac pocket sandwiched between Bosnian Serb units moving over the Una River from the south and rebel Serb forces in neighboring Croatia to the north. </P> <P> Bosnian radio reported fierce fighting in the region saying more than 2 000 explosions rocked the town of Bihac. </P> <P> ``They have been pulverizing Bihac and its outskirts '' said the report late Thursday. It said Serb shelling of the towns of Cazin Buzim Velika Kladusa and Bosanska Krupa had killed and wounded an unspecified number of civilians. </P> <P> The Serbs also were launching infantry attacks on almost all sections of the Bihac front the broadcast said. </P> <P> A U.N. official in Zagreb Croatia described the situation in the region as ``extremely unstable'' and the level of shelling as ``extremely high.'' Speaking on condition of anonymity he reported increased infantry fighting and said Serb claims their troops have advanced north over Una appeared true. </P> <P> Heavy shelling south of Bihac by Bosnian and Croatian Serbs on Thursday killed at least two civilians wounded another 10 and damaged more than 100 buildings said U.N. spokesman Maj. Koos Sol in Sarajevo. </P> <P> He and others said Croatian Serb and rebel Muslim forces were building up on the Croatian border near the fighting but could not confirm whether they had crossed over and were actively involved. </P> <P> The loss of the Bihac pocket would be devastating for the government army which overtook most of the region in August. Its fall would give the Serbs another piece of territory to connect rebel Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia with Serbia proper. </P> <P> Government troops meanwhile claimed further gains Thursday saying they moved closer to Serb-held Teslic and Doboj in northern Bosnia. There was no confirmation from Bosnian Serb military sources. </P> <P> Bosnian Serbs launched the war in April 1992 after Muslims and Croats voted to secede from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia and Karadzic has rejected international pressures to make peace. </P> <P> The U.N. command meanwhile accused the Muslim-led government of firing on its own territory in the capital Sarajevo apparently to provoke a NATO air strike against the Bosnian Serbs. There was no immediate government comment. </P> <P> The surge in fighting has heightened tensions throughout the country including Sarajevo where artillery and sniper fire are increasing. </P> <P> The Bosnian Serb assembly met Wednesday and Thursday before giving Karadzic his wide-ranging powers early today. The long closed-door debate reflected the reluctance of some Bosnian Serb politicians to give Karadzic so much power and move the Serbs further away from peace. </P> <P> The Bosnian Serbs who have enjoyed weapons superiority are now believed to be running short of fuel. They are also outnumbered more than 2-to-1 by combined government-Croat forces and morale is said to be low after they lost ground in a war they thought they had already won. </P> <P> Serbia the largest republic in Yugoslavia cut off supplies to the Bosnian Serbs in August to pressure them to accept an international peace plan they have repeatedly rejected. </P> <P> Under the plan Serbs would be forced to relinquish about one-third of the more than 70 percent of the republic they hold. </P> <P> American officials maintain a 1991 U.N. arms embargo prohibiting sales to all sides in the Balkan conflict has placed the Muslims at a disadvantage. </P> <P> Last month President Clinton signed a bill that would cut funding to enforce the embargo on Tuesday -- unless the United Nations lifts the ban first. </P> <P> A U.S.-sponsored resolution would exempt Bosnia's government from the embargo within six months if the Bosnian Serbs don't sign the peace treaty. </P> <P> NATO is in charge of enforcing the arms embargo. Officials at the alliance's Brussels headquarters said only two of the 18 enforcement ships are American and that weapons tend to come by land and air not sea. </P>,France,Serbia; Croatia,0.699999988,-0.699999988,0.003020526,

APW_ENG_19941111.0212,10/4/2004, <P> KARACHI Pakistan (AP) - Seventeen people were killed including a prominent politician in gun battles between rival political factions in Pakistan's largest city police said Friday. </P> <P> Fifty people were also wounded in the ongoing street fighting police said. </P> <P> In a separate clash Muslim militants demanding the imposition of Shariah or Islamic law fought with the security forces in the hills around the village of Inayat Kili about 200 kilometers (125 miles) northwest of Islamabad the capital. There was no immediate word on casualties. </P> <P> Karachi a sprawling port city of at least 10 million people has become increasingly chaotic in recent months. Gun fights between political factions and the security forces have become almost daily events. </P> <P> The latest trouble began when Mansoor Ahmed Khan the deputy secretary general of the opposition Mohajir Quami Movement was gunned down Thursday night along with three family members while they were in their car. </P> <P> As news of the killings spread violence erupted throughout central and eastern Karachi strongholds of the MQM. </P> <P> Police said a total of 13 people were shot dead Thursday evening and four more were killed Friday. More than 50 people were injured over the same period. </P> <P> Police blamed the shootings on infighting between the two MQM factions which represent mohajirs or Muslims who migrated from India. </P> <P> Most of the victims were killed by snipers or in drive-by shootings. Both methods of attack have become common in Karachi where automatic weapons are readily available. </P> <P> More than 150 people have died in shootings over the past five weeks and many fear that the violence is spiraling out of control. </P> <P> The MQM is the dominant political force in Karachi but the rival factions battle each other when not fighting the security forces. Khan belonged to the smaller breakaway group known as MQM (Haqiqi). </P> <P> His funeral was held Friday and police cordoned off streets in his neighborhood in an attempt to prevent further bloodshed. </P> <P> Both MQM factions are bitterly opposed to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government saying that she discriminates against the mohajirs. The government meanwhile describes the MQM as a terrorist group that uses violence to advance it political aims. </P> <P> Ms. Bhutto's government has been unable to bring Karachi under control and now faces the prospect of widespread turmoil in northwest Pakistan. </P> <P> Her government gave in to demands by Muslim militants earlier this week and agreed to implement Islamic law in parts of northwest Pakistan. The agreement brought the release of some 60 government officials held hostage for a week. </P> <P> However the deal did not cover nearby Inayat Kili where the latest fighting broke out Friday.

It is led by Fatih Shikaki a doctor based in Lebanon and Syria and reportedly gets support from Iran. </P> <P> The explosion occurred about 200 meters from the settlement of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip. Israeli troops and PLO police gather at the junction to conduct joint patrols. </P> <P> ``We heard a tremendous boom and smoke above the junction '' said Haim Yifrah a resident of the Jewish settlement who was near the intersection at the time of the attack. </P> <P> Leaflets after Abed's death threatened to attack a joint Israel-PLO patrol. </P> <P> The explosion occurred in an area of the Gaza Strip still controlled by Israeli forces.

APW_ENG_19941111.0233,7/7/2006, <P> Significant amounts of weapons and ammunition have been reaching Bosnian government forces since spring so the U.S. decision not to enforce the arms embargo will have little immediate impact. </P> <P> James P. Rubin spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said Washington would implement the requirements of a new defense bill which prohibits any U.S. funding for enforcing the embargo against Bosnia as of Nov. 15. </P> <P> In practical terms that means the three U.S. ships part of a 19-warship flotilla patrolling the Adriatic Sea will not be able to stop or divert ships suspected of or carrying weapons bound for Bosnia. </P> <P> However those ships representing 11 countries have also been enforcing the economic embargo on the former Yugoslavia since November 1992. </P> <P> According to NATO which runs the monitoring operation with the West European Union nearly all of the ships found to be carrying contraband were headed for Montenegro or Serbia the two republics remaining in Yugoslavia. </P> <P> It is believed most weapons reaching the Bosnians have either landed at one of Croatia's 50 airfields which range from large airports like Zagreb and Split to small grassy strips. They then make their way to Bosnia either by land or in small boats which skirt Croatia's nook-and-cranny coastline. </P> <P> In addition the Bosnians have been building a large airfield near government-held Visoko north of Sarajevo which army sources have said is to receive arms and ammunitions shipments. </P> <P> It is not clear what effect the U.S. decision will have on the overall monitoring operation on the Adriatic known as ``Operation Sharp Guard.'' </P> <P> One western military official speaking only on condition he not be named said the options are either to eliminate all U.S. participation which also includes vital communications and intelligence capabilities or to position U.S. warships where they are likely to encounter only ships carrying Yugoslav-bound contraband. </P> <P> ``One of the more serious implications of this is that it attracts nations to try to break the arms embargo now '' the western official said. ``There will be more traffic coming in trying to get by because they think there's a chance now. One of the greatest successes we've had is deterrence.'' </P> <P> Bosnia's Muslim-led government forces began receiving weapons and ammunition in significant amounts after it entered into a federation with Bosnia's Croats in March under pressure from the United States. The federation ended a yearlong internal war between the two former allies which had blocked access to Croatia and the sea. </P> <P> Croatia is also under the U.N. arms embargo but officials have noted a buildup in its military capabilities as well. </P> <P> Easing the blockade on Bosnia could also ease the embargo on Croatia which might get hold of shipments marked for Bosnia. </P>,Serbia,Montenegro; Croatia,0.002380335, , , 
APW_ENG_19941111.0240,3/30/2004, <P> At the White House an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the United States would stop diverting ships carrying arms to Bosnia or Croatia beginning at midnight Saturday.'' </P> <P> Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Clinton's action was consistent with the congressional ban.

Rubin a spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said Thursday in New York. </P> <P> Other U.S. officials who insisted on anonymity said Friday the allies had been consulted in advance and told the U.S. Navy would no longer divert ships carrying arms to Bosnia or Croatia which has aligned itself with the Muslim-led government against the Serbs. </P> <P> MORE </P>,France,Croatia,0.003467967, , , 
APW_ENG_19941111.0246,11/10/2004, <P> Russia with traditional cultural and religious ties to the Bosnian Serbs also has opposed any easing of the embargo against the Muslims. There was no assurance Moscow or China would not veto a U.S. resolution in the Council. </P> <P> In Bosnia the parliament of the Serbs' self-proclaimed republic gave near-dictatorial powers to their ultra-nationalist leader Friday in the expectation he can reverse their recent battlefield losses. </P> <P> Radovan Karadzic now can act alone in waging war instead of convening the assembly for important decisions and can declare martial law. </P> <P> Serb military officials claimed they were advancing on government forces in northwestern Bosnia. A U.N. official speaking on condition of anonymity said the Serb claims of an advance over the Una River appeared to be true. </P> <P> The embargo was imposed in 1991 against all parties in the conflict as Yugoslavia disintegrated and fighting began in Slovenia and Croatia. </P> <P> But the ban has never completely prevented Muslim-led Bosnian government forces from getting weapons bought clandestinely or donated by sympathetic governments and smuggled across the Croatian border. U.S. officials confirmed this week that weapons were being funneled through Zagreb the Croatian capital. </P> <P> Fighting in Bosnia began in April 1992 when Serbs rebelled after the Bosnia's ethnic Croats and Muslims voted to secede from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. About 200 000 people are dead or missing in the war. </P> <P> American officials maintain the embargo prohibiting sales to all sides has placed the Muslims at a disadvantage against the Bosnian Serbs. Until August they had been supplied by their patrons in Serbia the largest republic left in Yugoslavia. </P> <P> Serbia cut ties in August in a so-far unsuccessful effort to get the Bosnian Serbs to accept a peace plan already approved by Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation. </P> <P> The U.S. resolution would exempt Bosnia's government from the embargo within six months if the Bosnian Serbs don't sign the proposed peace treaty. </P> <P> Several nations are concerned that if the embargo is lifted the Bosnian Serbs might attack U.N. peacekeepers. There are also fears that the resolution would endanger humanitarian aid shipments and that Serbia could get involved in the war. </P> <P> British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd expressed concern Thursday that the U.S. action could split NATO. In an interview on BBC radio he insisted the embargo was ``a mandatory resolution of the Security Council and an agreed policy of the alliance.'' </P> <P> In Moscow where right-wing sentiment favors the Serbs lawmakers said lifting the embargo would intensify the fighting. Some suggested Russia should consider reacting by sending arms to its Serbian allies. </P> <P> ``We also have weapons and a possibility to supply them '' said Vladimir Lukin head of the foreign affairs committee of parliament's lower house and a former ambassador to Washington. ``We will protect our interests to the necessary degree.'' </P> <P> U.S. officials would not say what effect unilateral action would have on embargo enforcement by the United Nations and NATO.

APW_ENG_19941111.0247,1/13/2004, <P> The European Union on Friday asked its citizens to help fight fraud in the group's budget. </P> <P> Toll-free hot lines went into action in 11 of the dozen nations. Citizens speak to an answering machine at EU headquarters in Brussels and report individuals or companies they suspect of defrauding the EU budget. </P> <P> Greece has no toll-free capacity so it is trying to work out another system said Gerhart Hitzler a fraud specialist at the EU's executive agency the European Commission. </P> <P> Most fraud against the EU budget occurs as the EU pays subsidies to farmers or exporters of farm goods. Half of the bloc's 74-billion European currency unit (dlrs 92.5 billion) budget goes to agricultural spending mostly on subsidies for farmers. </P> <P> Another big budget chunk -- 23 billion Ecus (dlrs 29 billion) -- goes to development funds for the EU's poorer regions. </P> <P> Hitzler said known fraud consumes about 1 percent of the EU budget or about 700 000 Ecus (dlrs 875 000) contrary to reports of up to 15 percent. </P> <P> ``That's what we know about '' he said. ``But we suspect more. There are certainly cases which have gotten by us.'' </P> <P> A commission report said 1 298 cases of fraud in agricultural spending were found in the EU in 1993 accounting for 248 million Ecus (dlrs 310 million). </P> <P> Italy led the pack with 76 million Ecus (dlrs 95 million) worth of fraud cases mostly due to the way it prepays farm exporters for the money they will lose in selling expensive EU produce at lower world market prices. </P> <P> The report noted 58 cases involving development funds for the EU's own poorer regions accounting for 2 million Ecus (dlrs 2.5 million). </P> <P> While accusing ``Eurocrats'' in Brussels of using European taxpayers' money for their own profit is a popular sport in many member states Hitzler said nearly all the fraud occurs in member states. </P> <P> Hitzler said fewer than 10 EU civil servants are under investigation for fraud. All of them are suspected of helping agricultural exporters qualify for more export subsidies than they deserve. </P> <P> The number of reported fraud cases has risen since 1990 but Hitzler said that could mean detection is improving. </P> <P> Fighting fraud is up to member states rather than the commission Hitzler said. The EU gives fraud-fighting funds to national governments. </P> <P> The commission can punish member states for not fighting hard enough by reducing the amount of money they get to accomplish the fight. </P> <P> The commission cannot however pursue individuals or exporting companies for instance. </P> <P> ``We can make a member state act against a firm or a person '' Hitzler said. ``We can punish a member state but not a company or an individual.'' </P> <P> Germany and the Netherlands report a substantial number of fraud cases because they have good detection methods and are cooperating closely with the commission he said. </P> <P> Both also have large harbors where massive quantities of farm goods are imported and exported. </P> <P> Hitzler said Italy is cooperating very closely with the commission in spotting and fighting fraud. </P> <P> But most member states are not fully using the money allotted to them for combatting fraud. Britain for instance used only 10 percent of its allotment last year he said. </P> <P> While EU officials would like fraud against the EU budget to be punishable with the same penalty as fraud against national budgets that is so far the case in only three member states: Germany Italy and Portugal. </P>,Greece,Netherlands; Italy; Portugal; Germany,0.200000003,-0.100000001,0.036668748,

They are supported by maritime patrol aircraft. </P> <P> The arms embargo was imposed in 1991 against all parties in the conflict as Yugoslavia disintegrated and fighting began in Slovenia and Croatia. American officials maintain the embargo has placed the Muslims at a disadvantage against the Bosnian Serbs. </P> <P> President Clinton signed a bill last month that would cut funding to enforce the embargo against the Muslim-led government on Nov. 15 -- Tuesday -- unless the United Nations lifted the ban first. </P> <P> A U.S.-sponsored resolution to lift the embargo completely is pending before the U.N. Security Council. </P> <P> Robert Hunter the U.S. Ambassador to NATO told the AP that America's ``overall objective is to try to impress upon the Bosnian Serbs the need to accept the peace plan.'' </P> <P> But European nations are concerned that if the embargo is lifted the Bosnian Serbs might attack U.N. peacekeepers. </P> <P> Nearly 41 000 U.N. troops from 36 countries are in the former Yugoslavia.

The United States has no peacekeepers on the ground in Bosnia-Herzegovina. </P> <P> ``We plan to fully implement the legal requirement that no U.S. funds be used to prevent arms from going to the Bosnian government '' James P. Rubin a spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said Thursday in New York. </P> <P> Other U.S. officials who insisted on anonymity said today the allies had been consulted in advance and told the U.S. Navy would no longer divert ships carrying arms to Bosnia or Croatia which has aligned itself with the Muslim-led government against the Serbs. </P> <P> They said however the U.S. Navy would continue to intercept heavy weapons such as surface-to-air missiles bound for Bosnia as authorized by the congressional amendment. </P> <P> Russia with traditional cultural and religious ties to the Bosnian Serbs also has opposed any easing of the embargo against the Muslims. There was no assurance Moscow or China would not veto a U.S. resolution in the Council. </P> <P> In Bosnia the parliament of the Serbs' self-proclaimed republic gave near-dictatorial powers to their ultra-nationalist leader today in the expectation he can reverse their recent battlefield losses. </P> <P> Radovan Karadzic now can act alone in waging war instead of convening the assembly for important decisions and can declare martial law. </P> <P> Serb military officials claimed they were advancing on government forces in northwestern Bosnia. A U.N. official speaking on condition of anonymity said the Serb claims of an advance over the Una River appeared to be true. </P> <P> The embargo was imposed in 1991 against all parties in the conflict as Yugoslavia disintegrated and fighting began in Slovenia and Croatia. </P> <P> But the ban has never completely prevented Muslim-led Bosnian government forces from getting weapons bought clandestinely or donated by sympathetic governments and smuggled across the Croatian border. U.S. officials confirmed this week that weapons were being funneled through Zagreb the Croatian capital. </P> <P> Fighting in Bosnia began in April 1992 when Serbs rebelled after the Bosnia's ethnic Croats and Muslims voted to secede from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. About 200 000 people are dead or missing in the war. </P> <P> American officials maintain the embargo prohibiting sales to all sides has placed the Muslims at a disadvantage against the Bosnian Serbs. Until August they had been supplied by their patrons in Serbia the largest republic left in Yugoslavia. </P> <P> Serbia cut ties in August in a so-far unsuccessful effort to get the Bosnian Serbs to accept a peace plan already approved by Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation. </P> <P> The U.S. resolution would exempt Bosnia's government from the embargo within six months if the Bosnian Serbs don't sign the proposed peace treaty. </P> <P> Several nations are concerned that if the embargo is lifted the Bosnian Serbs might attack U.N. peacekeepers. There are also fears that the resolution would endanger humanitarian aid shipments and that Serbia could get involved in the war. </P> <P> British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd expressed concern today that the U.S. action could split NATO. In an interview on BBC radio he insisted the embargo was ``a mandatory resolution of the Security Council and an agreed policy of the alliance.'' </P> <P> In Moscow where right-wing sentiment favors the Serbs lawmakers said lifting the embargo would intensify the fighting. Some suggested Russia should consider reacting by sending arms to its Serbian allies. </P> <P> ``We also have weapons and a possibility to supply them '' said Vladimir Lukin head of the foreign affairs committee of parliament's lower house and a former ambassador to Washington. ``We will protect our interests to the necessary degree.'' </P> <P> U.S. officials would not say what effect unilateral action would have on embargo enforcement by the United Nations and NATO.

APW_ENG_19941111.0258,7/16/2006, <P> They're giving a going-away Garden party for Martina Navratilova and everybody's invited. Or at least 15 of her nearest competitors and 19 000 of her closest friends. </P> <P> ``I just hope I can still pick up the racket and hit the ball over the net through all the emotion that I am sure I will be feeling '' Navratilova said of her opening-round match Tuesday in the season-ending and for her career-ending Virginia Slims Championships. ``Hopefully that won't be the only day that I will be playing here.'' </P> <P> The week-long dlrs 3.5 million tournament begins Monday at Madison Square Garden where the top 16 singles players and top eight doubles teams of 1994 battle. The Slims Championships singles final is the only time during the year that women play a best-of-5 sets. </P> <P> The highlight of the week will take place Tuesday when the world's winningest player is honored. Half the expected sellout crowd -- the first 10 000 fans to enter the arena -- will receive a keepsake tennis ball inscribed with Navratilova's signature and year of her retirement. </P> <P> In a post-match tribute to the 38-year-old left-hander a banner with her name will be raised to the Garden ceiling where it will join the numbers that have been retired for the New York Knicks basketball team and New York Rangers ice hockey team. </P> <P> Navratilova's numbers are staggering. Since 1973 when she joined the pro tour she has won a record 167 singles titles -- more than any other man or woman -- and a record 165 doubles crowns. That has boosted her career earnings to more than dlrs 20 million. </P> <P> The Garden has been one of her most successful venues. Whether it's sponsored by Virginia Slims or Avon whether it's played in March or in November Navratilova has dominated this indoor event winning seven singles and 11 doubles titles and reaching the singles title match four other times. </P> <P> ``Playing in the Garden is a lot different than playing in the other indoor venues because the Garden is obviously very special but it is also very big and open '' said Craig Kardon Navratilova's coach. ``And the crowd is always a factor. </P> <P> ``It will be very interesting I think if she could put all her emotions aside as to this maybe being her last match or last week.'' </P> <P> Matching strokes and fragile emotions with Navratilova in the first-round battle will be Argentina's Gabriela Sabatini who won the Virginia Slims Championships in 1988 and the U.S. Open in 1990 but hasn't won a tournament of any kind since May 1992. </P> <P> Navratilova fell to sixth in the world rankings last week and risks finishing the year out of the top five for the first time since 1975. And unless she wins here she will snap her streak of winning two or more singles titles each year since 1975. Her only victory this year came at the Paris indoors in February. </P> <P> Yet in July she was a surprising finalist at Wimbledon -- a tournament she has won a record nine times -- and played perhaps her best tennis of the year last week when she lost to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the title match at the Bank of the West Classic in Oakland Calif. </P> <P> ``I hadn't played tennis like that in a long time '' Navratilova said after her three-set loss to Sanchez Vicario. ``It's nice to be able to play great tennis I just wish I could finish it off. When I play tennis like this I know I didn't retire too late.'' </P> <P> While Sanchez Vicario will be seeded No. 2 in the Slims Championships -- seedings are based on computer rankings -- she has dominated women's tennis this year winning both the French and U.S. Opens and finishing second at the Australian Open. </P> <P> Sanchez Vicario comes into the Garden riding a 21-match winning streak having captured her last four tournaments. She will take on Julie Halard of France in the opening round. </P> <P> The top seed is Steffi Graf who has been plagued by injuries and has not played since losing in the U.S. Open final. Graf reportedly practiced in New York earlier this month continued to have back pains and consequently withdrew from this past week's Virginia Slims of Philadelphia tournament. Her first-round opponent will be Brenda Schultz of the Netherlands. </P> <P> Other first-round matches pit Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez against Natalia Zvereva fourth-seeded Jana Novotna against Iva Majoli of Croatia No. 5 Mary Pierce against South Africa's Amanda Coetzer No. 7 Lindsay Davenport against Germany's Anke Huber and No. 8 Kimiko Date of Japan against Bulgaria's Magdalena Maleeva. Germany's Sabine Hack is an alternate. </P> <P> Despite what happens Tuesday Navratilova will play at least twice in the tournament. She qualified for the doubles competition with Manon Bollegraf of the Netherlands. </P> <P> Other doubles teams in the field are defending champions Gigi Fernandez and Zvereva Novotna and Sanchez Vicario Patty Fendick and Meredith McGrath veterans Pam Shriver and Elizabeth Smylie Davenport and Lisa Raymond Halard and Nathalie Tauziat and Jill Hetherington and Shaun Stafford. </P> <P> ``(Sometimes) I do think I'm playing one year too many '' Navratilova said recently ``but then I wouldn't have had Wimbledon and I wouldn't be here.'' </P>,Argentina,Netherlands; Japan; France; Bulgaria; Germany; Croatia,0.001518713, , ,

APW_ENG_19941111.0265,12/5/2004, <P> The debate over whether to invite German officials to Dutch Liberation Day observances has heated up all the more because the most prominent Dutchman is German-born. </P> <P> The long-running discussion flared up in the Dutch press Friday after Prince Bernhard father of Queen Beatrix expressed opposition to the idea of a German presence at the 50th anniversary of Dutch liberation in World War II. </P> <P> ``I wouldn't dream of it '' said 83-year-old Bernhard in a TV interview broadcast Thursday. ``It's the last thing I'd think of.'' </P> <P> Liberation day is celebrated each year on May 5th after somber May 4th memorial services for war dead. </P> <P> Bernhard a Prussian-born German prince married former Queen Juliana Beatrix's mother in 1936. When the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940 he joined the Allied cause serving with the Dutch squadrons of Britain's Royal Air Force. </P> <P> Even the Lockheed scandal of 1976 in which Bernhard allegedly received secret payments from the aircraft builder to secure Dutch contracts failed to dim his image for the Dutch. </P> <P> With his interest in wildlife conservation flying and veterans affairs the affable prince with the ever-present lapel carnation personifies adventure and sociability to the nation. </P> <P> Last month when asked about inviting Germans Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo said it was time for the Netherlands to stop turning its back on its neighbors. </P> <P> But in a letter to Parliament this week Prime Minister Wim Kok said that after talks with groups of former Dutch resistance members the government had decided to keep a ``national character'' to liberation events and keep them Dutch-only. </P> <P> Kok's letter proposes holding a separate symposium on May 8 to discuss 50 years of freedom to which German representatives will be invited. </P> <P> On the other side during the war was Bernhard's future son-in-law Claus now the husband of Queen Beatrix. </P> <P> Claus born into an aristocratic north German family served with the Wehrmacht in Denmark and Italy during the last year of the war became a German diplomat and married future Queen Beatrix in 1966. </P> <P> Although their marriage sparked the worst riots of the postwar Dutch era Claus too has endeared himself to his adopted country with his modest demeanor and his interest in Third World development. </P> <P> A spokesman for German Chancellor Helmut Kohl refused to comment on whether any German officials would take part in the Dutch commemoration events. </P> <P> German forces swarmed into the Netherlands on May 10 1940 and overpowered the Dutch army in five days forcing the government and royal family into exile in London. </P> <P> The harsh occupation crippled and starved the country stripping it of its food and resources to feed Germany and power its war industry. </P> <P> The Nazis shipped most of the prewar Dutch-Jewish population to concentration camps. </P> <P> Now the Netherlands' number one economic partner is Germany with the Dutch guilder effectively tied to the German mark and the nation overrun by German tourists in the summer. </P> <P> But wartime memories die hard and a common retort to vacationing Germans here is ``Where's my bicycle '' in reference to the hundreds of thousands the wartime occupiers confiscated from the Dutch. </P>,Netherlands,Denmark; Italy; Germany,1,-0.100000001,0.180384219,

APW_ENG_19941111.0297,4/20/2004, <P> The debate over whether to invite German officials to Dutch Liberation Day observances has heated up all the more because the most prominent Dutchman is German-born. </P> <P> The long-running discussion flared up in the Dutch press Friday after Prince Bernhard father of Queen Beatrix expressed opposition to the idea of a German presence at the 50th anniversary of Dutch liberation in World War II. </P> <P> ``I wouldn't dream of it '' said 83-year-old Bernhard in a TV interview broadcast Thursday. ``It's the last thing I'd think of.'' </P> <P> Liberation day is celebrated each year on May 5th after somber May 4th memorial services for war dead. </P> <P> Bernhard a Prussian-born German prince married former Queen Juliana Beatrix's mother in 1936. When the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940 he joined the Allied cause serving with the Dutch squadrons of Britain's Royal Air Force. </P> <P> Even the Lockheed scandal of 1976 in which Bernhard allegedly received secret payments from the aircraft builder to secure Dutch contracts failed to dim his image for the Dutch. </P> <P> With his interest in wildlife conservation flying and veterans affairs the affable prince with the ever-present lapel carnation personifies adventure and sociability to the nation. </P> <P> Last month when asked about inviting Germans Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo said it was time for the Netherlands to stop turning its back on its neighbors. </P> <P> But in a letter to Parliament this week Prime Minister Wim Kok said that after talks with groups of former Dutch resistance members the government had decided to keep a ``national character'' to liberation events and keep them Dutch-only. </P> <P> Kok's letter proposes holding a separate symposium on May 8 to discuss 50 years of freedom to which German representatives will be invited. </P> <P> On the other side during the war was Bernhard's future son-in-law Claus now the husband of Queen Beatrix. </P> <P> Claus born into an aristocratic north German family served with the Wehrmacht in Denmark and Italy during the last year of the war became a German diplomat and married future Queen Beatrix in 1966. </P> <P> Although their marriage sparked the worst riots of the postwar Dutch era Claus too has endeared himself to his adopted country with his modest demeanor and his interest in Third World development. </P> <P> A spokesman for German Chancellor Helmut Kohl refused to comment on whether any German officials would take part in the Dutch commemoration events. </P> <P> German forces swarmed into the Netherlands on May 10 1940 and overpowered the Dutch army in five days forcing the government and royal family into exile in London. </P> <P> The harsh occupation crippled and starved the country stripping it of its food and resources to feed Germany and power its war industry. </P> <P> The Nazis shipped most of the prewar Dutch-Jewish population to concentration camps. </P> <P> Now the Netherlands' number one economic partner is Germany with the Dutch guilder effectively tied to the German mark and the nation overrun by German tourists in the summer. </P> <P> But wartime memories die hard and a common retort to vacationing Germans here is ``Where's my bicycle '' in reference to the hundreds of thousands the wartime occupiers confiscated from the Dutch. </P>,Netherlands,Denmark; Italy; Germany,1,-0.100000001,0.180384219, 
APW_ENG_19941111.0298,11/5/2006, <P> The U.S. government will stop enforcing the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims beginning Saturday U.S. officials said Friday. </P> <P> The decision could widen a rift between Washington and it European allies on the war in the former Yugoslavia leaving the burden of enforcing the ban to the Europeans. </P> <P> Pentagon officials planned to explain the move later in the day. </P> <P> Congress voted last summer to cut off all funds for enforcing the arms embargo by Nov. 15 -- Tuesday -- if the Bosnian Serbs did not agree to a settlement by the deadline. </P> <P> Even while falling back from the most successful Muslim onslaught in the 2 1/2-year war the Serbs continue to reject a five-nation plan that would require them to relinquish about one-third of the territory they have captured. </P> <P> At the White House an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the United States would stop diverting ships carrying arms to Bosnia or Croatia beginning at midnight Saturday. </P> <P> Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Clinton's action was consistent with the congressional ban. However she added it was still his belief that ``it would be better to lift it multilaterally.'' </P> <P> Britain France and other Europeans wanted the embargo maintained out of concern any influx of weapons could increase fighting and also out of concern their peacekeepers might be targeted. The United States has no peacekeepers on the ground in Bosnia-Herzegovina. </P> <P> ``We plan to fully implement the legal requirement that no U.S. funds be used to prevent arms from going to the Bosnian government '' James P. Rubin a spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said Thursday in New York. </P> <P> Other U.S. officials who insisted on anonymity said Friday the allies had been consulted in advance and told the U.S. Navy would no longer divert ships carrying arms to Bosnia or Croatia which has aligned itself with the Muslim-led government against the Serbs. </P> <P> They said however the U.S. Navy would continue to intercept heavy weapons such as surface-to-air missiles bound for Bosnia as authorized by the congressional amendment. </P> <P> Russia with traditional cultural and religious ties to the Bosnian Serbs also has opposed any easing of the embargo against the Muslims. There was no assurance Moscow or China would not veto a U.S. resolution in the Council. </P> <P> In Bosnia the parliament of the Serbs' self-proclaimed republic gave near-dictatorial powers to their ultra-nationalist leader Friday in the expectation he can reverse their recent battlefield losses. </P> <P> Serb military officials claimed they were advancing on government forces in northwestern Bosnia. A U.N. official speaking on condition of anonymity said the Serb claims of an advance over the Una River appeared to be true. </P> <P> The embargo was imposed in 1991 against all parties in the conflict as Yugoslavia disintegrated and fighting began in Slovenia and Croatia. </P> <P> But the ban has never completely prevented Muslim-led Bosnian government forces from getting weapons bought clandestinely or donated by sympathetic governments and smuggled across the Croatian border. U.S. officials confirmed this week that weapons were being funneled through Zagreb the Croatian capital. </P> <P> Fighting in Bosnia began in April 1992 when Serbs rebelled after the Bosnia's ethnic Croats and Muslims voted to secede from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. About 200 000 people are dead or missing in the war. </P> <P> American officials maintain the embargo prohibiting sales to all sides has placed the Muslims at a disadvantage against the Bosnian Serbs. Until August they had been supplied by their patrons in Serbia the largest republic left in Yugoslavia. </P> <P> Serbia cut ties in August in a so-far unsuccessful effort to get the Bosnian Serbs to accept a peace plan already approved by Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation. </P> <P> The U.S. resolution at the United Nations would exempt Bosnia's government from the embargo within six months if the Bosnian Serbs don't sign the proposed peace treaty. </P> <P> Several nations are concerned that if the embargo is lifted the Bosnian Serbs might attack U.N. peacekeepers. There are also fears that the resolution would endanger humanitarian aid shipments and that Serbia could get involved in the war. </P> <P> British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd expressed concern Thursday that the U.S. action could split NATO. </P> <P> In Moscow where right-wing sentiment favors the Serbs lawmakers said lifting the embargo would intensify the fighting. Some suggested Russia should consider reacting by sending arms to its Serbian allies. </P> <P> U.S. officials would not say what effect unilateral action would have on embargo enforcement by the United Nations and NATO. The United States now has two ships and one airplane involved in NATO's efforts in the Adriatic Sea. </P>,China,Slovenia; France; Serbia; Croatia,0.00124217, , ,

APW_ENG_19941111.0318,9/10/2004, <P> President Clinton departed the Philippines and Indonesia Friday vowing to help ``turn insecurity about our future into confidence'' by expanding trade ties that he said offer untapped potential for growth. </P> <P> ``We are tearing down the old walls that have existed for so long between our domestic and foreign policy '' Clinton said in a White House departure statement. ``The ultimate goal is to produce a strong America.'' </P> <P> Clinton still feeling some jet lag from his last round of travel planned a two-day state visit to the Philippines before attending the second annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit with 17 Pacific Rim world leaders in Indonesia. </P> <P> The president taking note of his party's devastating losses on Election Day said dissatisfied voters had sent a message that Washington must ``create a stronger and more secure America.'' </P> <P> ``Too many Americans millions and millions of them still find the present and the future uncertain and unsettling '' he said. ``We simply must turn insecurity about our future into confidence.'' </P> <P> One part of that effort he said must be ``breaking down trade barriers opening markets and increasing our exports because export-related jobs pay significantly more on the average than those which are not related to exports.'' </P> <P> A day earlier in a Georgetown University speech Clinton said expanding trade with Asian and other nations would serve to strengthen the U.S. economy because ``the young vigorous economies of Asia and the Western Hemisphere offer enormous untapped potential for our people to prosper.'' </P> <P> Already he said one-third of U.S. exports go to Pacific Rim countries and their sales have created more than 2 million American jobs. </P> <P> Clinton was host for the first APEC summit last year in Seattle where leaders endorsed the principle of free trade without specifics. The goal this year is to create a free-trade zone among the nations by some date in the 21st century. </P> <P> ``Next week we'll move from a common vision to a common direction '' Clinton said. ``We'll work to set concrete goals to open the way for doing business in Asia taking down tariff walls eliminating non-tariff barriers simplifying procedures and standards to smooth the flow of goods.'' </P> <P> He said it was a demonstration of his commitment to expanding trade that he was traveling to Indonesia when he is still ``a little bit jet-lagged'' from his recent trip to the Middle East and a flurry of campaign travel. </P> <P> He said he wanted to dispel any misimpression among Asians who ``wonder whether we're ready to withdraw from the region'' because of stiff economic competition. ``Nothing could be further from the truth '' he said. </P> <P> The president pledged to raise concerns about human rights abuses in the region during his visit saying ``I don't think we have to choose between increasing trade and fostering human rights and open societies.'' </P> <P> ``I will do everything I can to be frank in terms of our differences as well as our potential partnerships with the Chinese with the Indonesians and with others '' Clinton said. </P> <P> In Indonesia President Suharto has fostered rapid economic development but critics fault the authoritarian nature of his government and its treatment of East Timor a former Portuguese colony annexed in 1976. Washington has warned that trade privileges could be stopped unless Indonesia recognizes worker rights. </P> <P> Amnesty International USA welcomed Clinton's ``recognition of the importance of human rights in trade discussions '' but said it regretted his ``failure to express his objection to the gross abuses carried out by the Indonesian government in the run-up to the APEC summit.'' </P> <P> ``President Clinton must now transform his stated commitment to human rights into specific recommendations for improving the human rights in the APEC member countries '' the organization's executive director William F. Schulz said in a statement. </P> <P> Clinton presented his trip to Asia as one of three ``crucial building blocks'' on trade that he will pursue in the next month. He challenged the lame-duck Congress to approve a 123-nation trade agreement and pledged to promote expanded trade with Latin America at a December summit in Miami. </P>,Philippines,Indonesia,0.100000001,0.012164461, ,

APW_ENG_19941111.0337,2/28/2005, <P> Serb troops bombarded Mostar and other frontlines in the southwest Friday as European governments warned that U.S. moves to ease the arms embargo on Bosnia could lead to more fighting and chaos. </P> <P> Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in an interview with the Sarajevo network pool hailed the U.S. decision as ``a turning point'' in the 31-month war that has left 200 000 dead or missing. </P> <P> Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic meanwhile wrested formal power from his self-styled parliament to act alone in waging war. </P> <P> But the decision stopped short of an immediate proclamation of martial law and draconian punishments for those refusing or ignoring military call-up. Karadzic said details of the war footing would be worked out and decided by another assembly session at an unspecified date. </P> <P> That suggested many in the assembly were reluctant to put themselves under the authority of the extremist Karadzic. The Bosnian Serbs have become increasingly isolated since former ally Serbia severed ties fuel and other supplies in August. </P> <P> But the Serbs fought back on the battlefield pounding frontlines throughout western Bosnia-Herzegovina. </P> <P> The Bosnian government army's Fourth Corps which is responsible for that region called it the heaviest shelling since the early stages of the war. </P> <P> The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA claimed however that it was government forces on the offensive in at least part of the area. Nevesinje a Serb-held town southwest of Mostar and other Serb villages were under artillery fire it said. There was no independent confirmation. </P> <P> Demilitarized zones of Mostar which is divided into western Croat and eastern Muslim halves came under fierce shelling from Bosnian Serb positions Friday afternoon according to residents. U.N. troops confirmed at least some shells came from Serb guns. </P> <P> Schools were closed and civilians ordered to stay indoors along a 60 kilometer (40 mile) stretch of frontlines from Stolac south of Mostar to the more northerly town of Konjic Sarajevo radio said. </P> <P> The bombardment in the southwest followed a similar punishing assault Thursday on the northwestern enclave of Bihac where Muslim-led government troops had made significant gains in recent weeks. </P> <P> Maj. Mohammed Bashir spokesman for the Bangladeshi U.N. battalion in the Bihac pocket said two people were killed and 10 wounded in two villages just south of Bihac city. </P> <P> More than 800 shells rained down partly or wholly destroying at least 150 houses and two churches Bashir said. </P> <P> Much of the shelling came from Serb-held territory in neighboring Croatia Bashir said. </P> <P> Several U.N. officials said they had heard the Croatian Serbs were massing troops near the fighting but had no confirmation that they had crossed into Bosnia. </P> <P> The United Nations' most senior man in former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi headed to the Serb stronghold of Pale east of Sarajevo for talks with Karadzic and other leaders after meetings with Bosnian government leaders in Sarajevo. </P> <P> Akashi and Bosnian Vice-President Ejup Ganic discussed mostly ways to secure a vital supply route for Sarajevo over Mount Igman. The road often comes under fire from Bosnian Serb positions. </P> <P> However the Bosnian Serbs have been intransigent about pulling back or giving guarantees of safety. They apparently want to keep Sarajevo under tight siege and are angered that government troops have used a demilitarized zone in the area to launch attacks on the Serbs. </P> <P> European governments meanwhile voiced consternation at word that the United States will stop enforcing the international arms embargo on Bosnia. It is part of an embargo imposed on all former Yugoslavia in 1991 when war was raging in Croatia. </P> <P> Many U.S. politicians feel the embargo has put the Bosnian government at a disadvantage against the much better armed Bosnian Serbs who hold 70 percent of Bosnia. </P> <P> British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called the U.S. decision ``a worrying problem.'' </P> <P> Officials of the Western European Union said the move was divisive. </P> <P> In Serb-dominated Yugoslavia Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic told the Tanjug news agency that the decision was ``the last drop in the glass'' of America's siding with one party in the Bosnian war. ``Such a decision cannot improve peace and prospects for a political solution '' he said. </P>,Serbia,Croatia,0.00310838, , ,

APW_ENG_19941111.0344,5/4/2005, <P> Even if Mozambique's former rebel movement rejected results of the first multiparty election it would negotiate instead of returning to war a top official said Friday. </P> <P> ``The fact that the elections were fraudulent will not stop the country from moving ahead '' said Raul Domingos chief negotiator for the Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) rebels that fought a 15-year civil war against the government. </P> <P> RENAMO has repeatedly claimed widespread fraud during the Oct. 27-29 voting and threatened to reject the result raising fears of a possible return to warfare as occurred in Angola two years ago. </P> <P> But Domingos rejected warfare as an option after two years of relative calm following a 1992 peace pact that set up the election. </P> <P> A return to war ``would mean the destruction of achievements that took years to build '' he told a news conference. </P> <P> ``I can assure you that RENAMO does not have this in mind '' he said adding later: ``We are able to overcome problems through dialogue.'' </P> <P> According to the latest partial results announced by the National Election Commission RENAMO and its leader Afonso Dhlakama were running a distant second to the governing Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) and President Joaquim Chissano. </P> <P> Chissano had 60 percent of the votes for president compared to 30 percent for Dhlakama.

APW_ENG_19941111.0355,11/19/2004, <P> Two things that terrify residents of Norway's arctic provinces are the European Union and the threat of radiation and pollution from the nearby Kola Peninsula of Russia. </P> <P> So proponents of membership Friday wooed voters in the deeply anti-EU north with assurances that the best way to make sure the Kola gets cleaned up is for Norway to join the EU. </P> <P> ``An environmental cleanup on the Kola will be high on the EU's agenda if Norway is sitting at the table '' promised Thorvald Stoltenberg who will be Norway's EU commissioner if Norwegians approve membership in a Nov. 28 national referendum. </P> <P> Norwegians are split over membership with recent polls predicting a dead heat if Sweden approves membership in its own referendum on Sunday. </P> <P> A fact-finding team led by the next EU commissioner for the environment Ritt Bjerregaard of Denmark was headed to the north for a week-long tour of the Kola Peninsula. </P> <P> Northwestern Russia's Kola Peninsula which borders arctic Norway is a place of overflowing radioactive waste dumps up to 2 000 nuclear warheads 155 nuclear-powered submarines and a nuclear power plant deemed dangerous by Western experts. </P> <P> Just a few kilometers (miles) from the Norwegian border is the town of Nikel where an outdated metals smelter spews more sulphur dioxide each year than all of Scandinavia put together produces according to Norwegian experts. </P> <P> The smoke from the smelters has killed virtually all plant life in a 10-kilometer (six-mile) radius around Nikel and inspired Norwegians in the northern province of Finnmark to found a group called ``Stop the Death Clouds.'' </P> <P> But the north is also a stronghold of opposition to EU membership with 75 percent of those asked in some polls saying they don't want to join. Fishing is the lifeblood of northern Norway and residents fear that they would have to share stocks in the arctic Barents Sea with other European countries. </P> <P> Stoltenberg a former foreign minister and now U.N. peace broker for former Yugoslavia assured Norwegians that he would fight to get the EU involved in the Kola cleanup which some experts say could cost dlrs 1.5 billion. </P> <P> ``I hope and believe that my personal engagement in all matters concerning the Barents region is clear to people in the north '' Stoltenberg told the Norwegian news agency NTB during a brief visit to Oslo. </P> <P> Bjerregaard who stopped in Oslo on her way to the arctic told NTB that the Union efforts on the Kola depend on Norway. </P> <P> ``That doesn't mean that the EU will not become involved in the Kola anyway but the priority depends a lot on Norway's efforts '' she told reporters. </P>,Sweden,Norway; Denmark,0.008388028, , , 
APW_ENG_19941111.0366,5/18/2006, <P> Serb troops bombarded Mostar and other frontlines in the southwest Friday as European governments warned that U.S. moves to ease the arms embargo on Bosnia could lead to more fighting and chaos. </P> <P> One girl was killed and five or six other children were wounded when a shell hit near Mostar's heavily damaged Roman Catholic cathedral said Dragan Gajic a spokesman for the European Union which administers part of the badly damaged city. </P> <P> A priest quoted by the Croatian news agency HINA said about 50 children were attending catechism when tragedy struck. </P> <P> Mostar's EU administrator Hans Koschnik condemned the attack and said he expected ``strong reaction from Europe.'' </P> <P> ``These victims are not war victims but victims of an attack on the civilian population '' he stressed. </P> <P> HABENA quoted Dr. Zoran Rebac of Mostar hospital as saying surgeons were fighting for the lives of some of the wounded. </P> <P> Mostar cathedral lost its roof in 1992 Serb shelling and was heavily damaged in Muslim-Croat fighting last year. </P> <P> U.N. Spanish peacekeepers in the area said they had no confirmation where the shell came from. But at least some shells that hit Mostar Friday were from Serb positions a spokesman said. </P> <P> Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic meanwhile wrested formal power from his self-styled parliament to act alone in waging war. </P> <P> But the decision stopped short of an immediate proclamation of martial law.

APW_ENG_19941111.0373,10/25/2005, <P> Significant amounts of weapons and ammunition have been reaching Bosnian government forces since spring so the U.S. decision not to enforce the arms embargo will have little immediate impact. </P> <P> Washington says it will stop enforcing the embargo against Bosnia after midnight Saturday. </P> <P> That means three U.S. ships part of a 19-warship flotilla patrolling the Adriatic Sea will not stop or divert ships suspected of carrying weapons bound for Bosnia. </P> <P> A White House official speaking on condition of anonymity said the United States will help enforce other embargos. </P> <P> The Bosnian Serbs also are under an arms embargo and the former Yugoslavia has been under an economic embargo since November 1992 for fomenting war. </P> <P> According to NATO nearly all ships found to be carrying contraband were headed for Montenegro or Serbia the two republics remaining in Yugoslavia which supplied their Serb brethren with weapons fuel and ammunution until August. </P> <P> Most weapons reaching the Muslim-led Bosnian government are believed to have arrived at one of Croatia's 50 airfields which range from large airports such as Zagreb and Split to small grass airstrips. They reach Bosnia by land or in small boats which skirt Croatia's nook-and-cranny coastline. </P> <P> In addition Bosnia has been building a large airfield near Visoko north of Sarajevo which army sources say is to receive arms and ammunitions shipments. </P> <P> It is not clear what effect the U.S. decision will have on the overall monitoring operation on the Adriatic. </P> <P> One western military official speaking on condition he not be named said the options are either to eliminate all U.S. participation which also includes vital communications and intelligence capabilities or to position U.S. warships where they are likely to encounter only ships carrying Yugoslav-bound contraband. </P>,Serbia,Montenegro; Croatia,0.003081949, , , 
APW_ENG_19941111.0375,9/8/2005, <P> President Clinton still smarting from his party's losses on Election Day set out Friday for an Asian trade conference suggesting it could help bring prosperity to dissatisfied Americans. </P> <P> ``We simply must turn insecurity about our future into confidence '' Clinton said in a Rose Garden departure statement. ``The ultimate goal is to produce a strong America.'' </P> <P> After a brief stop in Alaska Clinton planned a two-day visit to the Philippines before attending the second annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum with 17 other world leaders in Indonesia. </P> <P> Clinton whose party suffered steep losses in congressional and statehouse races around the country said he would carry with him voters' message that they want Washington ``to create a stronger a more secure America.'' </P> <P> Expanding world trade he said will serve that end. In fact exports are expected to be the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. economy over the next decade. </P> <P> Clinton's remarks seemed designed to allay the fears of many Americans that expanding trade would only end up costing more U.S. jobs. Only a day earlier Clinton had worried that many Americans see trade as ``just another threat ready to blow away the prospects of a stable job at a good wage.'' </P> <P> Offering words of reassurance Clinton said Friday ``We are pursuing this strategy because ... it offers the best opportunity for them to acquire the kind of security for their families that so many millions of Americans are still struggling to achieve.'' </P> <P> Clinton played host for the first APEC summit last year in Seattle where leaders endorsed the principle of free trade without specifics. The goal this year is to create a free-trade zone among the nations by some date in the 21st century. </P> <P> APEC is one of three legs in the president's post-election endeavor to promote trade and regain momentum after the midterm losses. The others are a December summit of the Americas in Miami and efforts to push a 123-nation world trade agreement through the lame-duck Congress. </P> <P> The Democrats' election losses have complicated Clinton's mission by diminishing his stature abroad and stirring talk about delaying a vote on the trade accord until the Republican-led Congress convenes in January. </P> <P> Glossing over such concerns Clinton said efforts to expand trade ``give us a unique opportunity to join hands'' across party lines. </P> <P> The president said it was time to expand the country's focus in international economics beyond the ``mature and strong economies of Europe and Japan.'' </P> <P> ``The new century demands a new strategy '' he said pointing to untapped potential throughout the Asia-Pacific region. </P> <P> Clinton said his APEC visit also would give him a chance to discuss with world leaders the effort to keep North Korean from developing nuclear weapons. </P> <P> ``No problem is more important to the United States and its allies than stopping the proliferation of nuclear materials and weapons in general and specifically ending North Korea's nuclear program '' he said. </P> <P> The president also said he would use the trip to raise concerns about human-rights abuses in the region saying ``we must continue to pursue this path with patience persistence and determination.'' </P> <P> Indonesia's President Suharto has fostered rapid economic development in his country but critics fault the authoritarian nature of his government. </P> <P> Clinton's first scheduled stop outside the United States was Manila where he planned meetings with Philippine President Fidel Ramos visits to World War II battle sites and a meeting with American business executives about the importance of free trade. </P>,Philippines,Japan; Indonesia,0.001621093, , , 
APW_ENG_19941111.0377,12/21/2005, <P> A look at the parties involved in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina: --The Muslim-dominated Bosnian government led by President Alija Izetbegovic is fighting to maintain a unified multi-ethnic Bosnia. It includes Serbs and Croats. It has recently renewed an alliance with independent Bosnian Croat militias. The government holds Bosnia's U.N. seat. --Rebel Bosnian Serbs led by Radovan Karadzic went to war after Bosnia-Herzegovina declared independence from Yugoslavia in March 1992. Armed and supplied by neighboring Serbia Serb forces have captured 70 percent of Bosnia's territory. They want to unite their lands with Serbia and Serb areas in neighboring Croatia. --Serbia led by President Slobodan Milosevic under increasing pressure from crippling U.N. economic sanctions imposed to punish Yugoslavia -- of which Serbia is the dominant state -- for fomenting war in Bosnia cut off supplies to the rebels in August. --Bosnian Croats captured territories in western Bosnia-Herzegovina early in the war and declared their own state. Under U.S. pressure they agreed last spring to form a federation with the Muslim-led government and have begun to cooperate with it on the battlefield. </P>,Serbia,Croatia,0.051317688, , , 
APW_ENG_19941111.0380,1/8/2006, <P> Seventh-seeded Magnus Larsson Friday survived his second deciding tiebreak in as many days to set up a surprise semifinal against France's Olivier Delaitre in the dlrs 1.1 million European Community Championship. </P> <P> Larsson struggled through three tiebreaks to end the unlikely challenge of Canadian qualifier Sebastien Lareau 7-6 (7-3) 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-5). </P> <P> Delaitre beat Swede Jonas Bjorkman with a straightforward 6-3 6-3. </P> <P> Defending champion Pete Sampras played Zimbabwe's Byron Black later Friday and will face the winner of the match between sixth-seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia and American Jared Palmer. </P> <P> After saving six matchpoints and struggling through two tiebreaks on Thursday before beating Cedric Pioline the world's No. 22 didn't make it any easier on himself against Lareau. </P> <P> But experience -- and an array of great backcourt drives -- were finally too much for the Canadian who belied his world ranking of 123 throughout the week. Lareau 21 beat second seed Michael Stich in the first round. </P> <P> In the first set Larsson imposed himself only in the tiebreak when the pressure got to Lareau. Passing shots and aces from Larsson combined with unforced errors from the Canadian gave the seventh-seed the first set. </P> <P> The players exchanged service breaks early on in the second and Larsson was two points from the match in the tenth game. But Lareau sent the set into another tiebreaker producing two aces to keep the Swede at bay. </P> <P> In the decider Lareau came out on top 7-5 to the delight of the 5 000 fans at the Sports Palace. </P> <P> The third set produced more of the same Larsson often scoring with drives from the backcourt while Lareau stayed even with winners at the net. When Lareau was two points from the match in the 10th game it was Larsson's turn to reply and an ace and a forehand drive kept him alive until the final tiebreak. </P> <P> One of his many great service returns finally gave the Swede the match. </P> <P> Delaitre ranked 64th in the world had an easy passage into the semifinal when Bjorkman showed little of the aggression that had marked his good run at the tournament. </P> <P> Without any problem Delaitre slowed down play with lots of slices drawing Bjorkman into many easy misses. ``I thought he would come to the net a lot more. Instead he just let me impose play '' he said. </P> <P> Bjorkman who had beaten fifth-seeded Jason Stoltenberg in the opening round failed to bounce back after his mediocre first set and lost in just over an hour. </P> <P> Delaitre 27 reached his second semifinal of the year. He lost the final in Indianapolis last August to Wayne Ferreira. </P> <P> After his upset of No. 4 seed Richard Krajicek in the opening round the Frenchman hasn't looked back. </P> <P> ``I feel no pressure whatsoever. Soon I'll be on holiday anyhow '' he said of his season-ending tournament. </P> <P> Like Sampras and Stefan Edberg Delaitre has been suffering from a throat ache and the Frenchman was playing on antibiotics. </P> <P> Sampras overcame the illness early in the week but Edberg had to withdraw on Thursday allowing American Jared Palmer straight into the quarterfinals. </P>,Zimbabwe,France; Australia,0.00266407, , ,

Arms dealers could try even harder to breach the embargo and sell weapons. </P> <P> The United States said it would stop enforcing the arms embargo against the Muslim-led Bosnian government Saturday under a new defense bill prohibiting U.S. funding for the effort. The United States also is seeking to have the U.N. Security Council lift the arms embargo imposed on the countries of former Yugoslavia in 1991. </P> <P> Allies notably Britain and France argue that more weapons mean more fighting that would endanger their peacekeepers in Bosnia. </P> <P> The U.S. decision means that three American ships in a 19-warship flotilla patrolling the Adriatic Sea will not intercept ships carrying weapons bound for Bosnia. </P> <P> One exception will be ships found carrying heavy weapons such as surface-to-air missiles which would be viewed as a threat to NATO planes enforcing the ``no-fly zone'' over Bosnia. </P> <P> The United States will also no longer share intelligence on arms bound for Bosnia. </P> <P> The new limits on U.S. participation in the Adriatic monitoring were expected to have little effect. </P> <P> Most of the foreign munitions reaching the Bosnians are believed to come via one of Croatia's 50 airfields which range from large airports like Zagreb and Split to small grassy strips. They then make their way to Bosnia either by land or in small boats which skirt Croatia's nook-and-cranny coastline. </P> <P> NATO has no authority to challenge boats traveling from one Croatian port to another a spokesman said. Only four of more than 3 000 ships inspected or diverted since the Adriatic patrols began in November 1992 have been found carrying weapons for Bosnia. </P> <P> ``The only area where the Americans are actively involved is in policing the Adriatic and that's an area where nobody goes through anymore '' said Paul Beaver a Balkans military analyst for Jane's Information Group of defense journals in London. </P> <P> Bosnia's government began receiving weapons and ammunition in significant amounts after it joined in a U.S.-brokered federation with Bosnia's Croats in March. The federation opened the weapons smuggling route from Croatia and the sea. </P> <P> In addition the Bosnians have been building a large airfield near government-held Visoko north of Sarajevo which army sources have said is to receive munitions shipments. </P> <P> Breaches of the arms embargo are as old as the war in former Yugoslavia but military analysts such as Beaver noted a marked increase in deliveries of weapons and raw materials after the federation formed. </P> <P> Such deliveries many confirmed by senior Bosnian Army officials have included sophisticated Chinese- and Soviet-built wire-guided anti-tank missile systems U.S.-designed Stinger anti-aircraft missiles multiple rocket-launcher systems mortars and automatic weapons. </P> <P> Most of the weapons apparently were bought with money from Muslim countries notably Iran and Saudi Arabia analysts say. </P> <P> Fran Visnar a Croatian military analyst said the U.S. action could be a two-edged sword if its decision is interpreted as a de-facto lifting of the arms embargo. Russia a traditional ally of Serbia could start openly arming Bosnian Serbs he said. </P> <P> ``The decision itself is a dangerous one because it means that the world superpower has decided to let things develop in their own way without controlling the war through the embargo '' Visnar said. </P> <P> It was not clear what effect the U.S. decision would have on the overall Adriatic monitoring operation known as ``Operation Sharp Guard.'' </P> <P> The 11-nation patrol conducted by NATO and the West European Union also enforces the economic embargo on the former Yugoslavia. </P>,France,Serbia; Croatia,0.5,-0.5,0.002412446,

The federation opened the weapons smuggling route from Croatia and the sea. </P> <P> In addition the Bosnians have been building a large airfield near government-held Visoko north of Sarajevo which army sources have said is to receive munitions shipments. </P> <P> Breaches of the arms embargo are as old as the war in former Yugoslavia but military analysts such as Beaver noted a marked increase in deliveries of weapons and raw materials after the federation formed. </P> <P> Such deliveries many confirmed by senior Bosnian Army officials have included sophisticated Chinese- and Soviet-built wire-guided anti-tank missile systems U.S.-designed Stinger anti-aircraft missiles multiple rocket-launcher systems mortars and automatic weapons. </P> <P> Most of the weapons apparently were bought with money from Muslim countries notably Iran and Saudi Arabia analysts say. </P> <P> Fran Visnar a Croatian military analyst said the U.S. action could be a two-edged sword if its decision is interpreted as a de-facto lifting of the arms embargo. Russia a traditional ally of Serbia could start openly arming Bosnian Serbs he said. </P> <P> ``The decision itself is a dangerous one because it means that the world superpower has decided to let things develop in their own way without controlling the war through the embargo '' Visnar said. </P> <P> It was not clear what effect the U.S. decision would have on the overall Adriatic monitoring operation known as ``Operation Sharp Guard.'' </P> <P> The 11-nation patrol conducted by NATO and the West European Union also enforces the economic embargo on the former Yugoslavia. </P>,France,Serbia; Croatia,0.5,-0.5,0.002412446, 
APW_ENG_19941111.0396,12/31/2005, <P> Serb troops bombarded southwestern Mostar Friday hitting a church full of children. European governments warned that U.S. moves to ease the arms embargo on Bosnia could mean more fighting and chaos. </P> <P> One girl was killed and five or six other children were wounded when a shell hit Mostar's heavily damaged Roman Catholic cathedral said Dragan Gajic a spokesman for the European Union which administers part of the city. </P> <P> Croatian TV said a second girl died of seroius injuries in hospital. </P> <P> The shell hit the wall between the cathedral and a restoed rectory where children were attending catechism. Others were standing outside. Croatian TV showed footage of the damaged wall and fresh blood stains on the floor. </P> <P> Mostar's EU administrator Hans Koschnik condemned the attack and said he expected ``strong reaction from Europe.'' </P> <P> ``These victims are not war victims but victims of an attack on the civilian population '' he stressed calling the attack by the Serbs a crime. </P> <P> Ramon Alvarez a spokesman for the Spanish battalion near Mostar confirmed one dead and four to six wounded in the western Croat part of Mostar. On the eastern Muslim side another eight people were wounded two of them seriously. </P> <P> Mostar cathedral lost its roof in 1992 Serb shelling and was heavily damaged in Muslim-Croat fighting last year. </P> <P> U.N. spokesman Lt. Col. Tim Spicer in Sarajevo said the city was shelled by Serbs who were apparently responding to a joint infantry attack by government troops and Croat militias south of Mostar. </P> <P> Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic meanwhile wrested formal power from his self-styled parliament to act alone in waging war. </P> <P> But the decision stopped short of an immediate proclamation of martial law. Karadzic said details of the war footing would be worked out and decided by another assembly session. </P> <P> That suggested many in the assembly were reluctant to put themselves under the authority of the extremist Karadzic. The Bosnian Serbs have become increasingly isolated since former ally Serbia severed ties fuel and other supplies in August. </P> <P> But the Serbs fought back on the battlefield pounding frontlines throughout western Bosnia-Herzegovina. </P> <P> Schools were closed and civilians ordered to stay indoors along a 60 kilometer (40 mile) stretch of frontlines from Stolac south of Mostar to Konjic to the north Sarajevo radio said. </P> <P> The bombardment in the southwest followed a similar punishing assault Thursday on the northwestern enclave of Bihac where Muslim-led government troops had made significant gains in recent weeks. </P> <P> Maj. Mohammad Bashir spokesman for the Bangladeshi U.N. battalion in the Bihac pocket said two people were killed and 10 wounded in two villages just south of Bihac city. </P> <P> More than 800 shells rained down partly or wholly destroying at least 150 houses and two churches Bashir said. Much of the shelling came from Serb-held territory in neighboring Croatia he said. </P> <P> Several U.N. officials said they had heard the Croatian Serbs were massing troops near the fighting but had no confirmation they had crossed into Bosnia. </P> <P> Both Bosnian and Croatian officials protested the Serb attacks and criticized the U.N. force for not protecting Bihac and for failing to prevent assaults from U.N.-patrolled Serb-held areas of Croatia. </P> <P> The top U.N. officials in former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi headed to the Serb stronghold of Pale east of Sarajevo for talks with Karadzic and other leaders after meetings with Bosnian government leaders in Sarajevo. </P> <P> Akashi and Bosnian Vice-President Ejup Ganic discussed mostly ways to secure a vital supply route for Sarajevo over Mount Igman which is often under fire from Serb positions. </P> <P> Bosnian Serbs have been intransigent about pulling back or giving guarantees of safety. They apparently want to keep Sarajevo under tight siege and are angered that government troops have used a demilitarized zone in the area to launch attacks on them. </P> <P> European governments meanwhile voiced consternation at word that the United States will stop enforcing the international arms embargo on Bosnia. It is part of an embargo imposed on all former Yugoslavia in 1991 when war was raging in Croatia. </P> <P> Many U.S. politicians feel the embargo has put the Bosnian government at a disadvantage against the much better armed Bosnian Serbs who hold 70 percent of Bosnia. </P> <P> British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called the U.S. decision ``a worrying problem.'' Officials of the Western European Union said the move was divisive. </P> <P> Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in an interview with the Sarajevo network pool hailed the U.S. decision as ``a turning point'' in the 31-month war that has left 200 000 dead or missing. </P> <P> Karadzic said the move was ``ultimate proof'' of U.S. bias. </P>,Serbia,Croatia,0.002088106, , , 
APW_ENG_19941111.0398,12/28/2006, <P> Seventh-seeded Magnus Larsson Friday survived his second deciding tiebreak in as many days to set up a surprise semifinal against France's Olivier Delaitre in the dlrs 1.1 million European Community Championship. </P> <P> Larsson struggled through three tiebreaks to end the unlikely challenge of Canadian qualifier Sebastien Lareau 7-6 (7-3) 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-5). </P> <P> Delaitre beat Swede Jonas Bjorkman in a workman-like 6-3 6-3. </P> <P> Defending champion Pete Sampras played Zimbabwe's Byron Black later Friday and will face the winner of the match between sixth-seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia and American Jared Palmer. </P> <P> After saving six matchpoints and struggling through two tiebreaks on Thursday before beating Cedric Pioline the ATP Tour's 22nd-ranked player didn't make it any easier on himself against Lareau. </P> <P> But experience -- and an array of backcourt drives -- were finally too much for the Canadian who belied his world ranking of 123 throughout the week. Lareau 21 beat second seed Michael Stich in the first round. </P> <P> In the first set Larsson imposed himself only in the tiebreak when the pressure got to Lareau. Passing shots and aces from Larsson combined with unforced errors from the Canadian gave the seventh-seed the first set. </P> <P> The players exchanged service breaks early on in the second and Larsson was two points from the match in the 10th game. But Lareau sent the set into another tiebreaker producing two aces to keep the Swede at bay. </P> <P> In the decider Lareau came out on top 7-5 to the delight of the 5 000 fans at the Sports Palace. </P> <P> The third set produced more of the same Larsson often scoring with drives from the backcourt while Lareau stayed even with winners at the net. When Lareau was two points from the match in the 10th game it was Larsson's turn to reply and an ace and a forehand drive kept him alive until the final tiebreak. </P> <P> One of his many great service returns finally gave the Swede the match. </P> <P> Delaitre ranked 64th had an easy passage into the semifinal when Bjorkman showed little of the aggression that had marked his good run at the tournament. </P> <P> Without any problem Delaitre slowed down play with lots of slices drawing Bjorkman into many easy misses. </P> <P> ``I thought he would come to the net a lot more. Instead he just let me impose play '' he said. </P> <P> Bjorkman who had beaten fifth-seeded Jason Stoltenberg in the opening round failed to bounce back after his mediocre first set and lost in just over an hour. </P> <P> Delaitre 27 reached his second semifinal of the year. He lost the final in Indianapolis last August to Wayne Ferreira. </P> <P> After his upset of No. 4 seed Richard Krajicek in the opening round the Frenchman hasn't looked back. </P> <P> ``I feel no pressure whatsoever. Soon I'll be on holiday anyhow '' he said of his season-ending tournament. </P> <P> Like Sampras and Stefan Edberg Delaitre has been suffering from a throat ache and the Frenchman was playing on antibiotics. </P> <P> Sampras overcame the illness early in the week but Edberg had to withdraw on Thursday allowing American Jared Palmer straight into the quarterfinals. </P>,Zimbabwe,France; Australia,0.002621045, , , 
APW_ENG_19941111.0399,10/19/2005, <P> A suicide bicyclist veered behind the concrete blocks of an Israeli checkpoint Friday and ignited explosives strapped to his body killing three soldiers and wounding at least 11 including a Palestinian family. </P> <P> Islamic Jihad one of the most violent factions opposed to the Israel-PLO peace talks said it carried out the attack to avenge the car bomb killing of a Jihad leader blamed on Israel. </P> <P> The bombing occurred at one of the largest crossroads on Gaza's north-south highway jointly patrolled by Israel and Palestinian troops. Israel maintains a checkpoint there to monitor traffic approaching Netzarim a tiny settlement that the Palestinians want removed. Palestinian police are stationed several dozen meters (yards) nearby. </P> <P> The bomber apparently took advantage of confusion caused by a planned protest at the intersection by Palestinian demonstrators demanding that Israel lift restrictions on Gazan workers entering its territory imposed after a series of violent attacks. </P> <P> Israel's army spokesman identified two of the dead soldiers as Lt. Yehezhkel Sapir 36 and Lt. Yotam Rahat 31. </P> <P> Both Israeli and Palestinian officials seemed at a loss on dealing with such lightening strikes where their responsibilities overlap. They planned a meeting late Friday on the issue. </P> <P> ``There are no guarantees for anything in life '' said the Israeli chief-of-staff Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak after inspecting the site. ``When a suicide bomber manages to reach such a place there is no sure way to prevent there being victims.'' </P> <P> Army spokesmen said three Israeli soldiers were killed and six wounded. In Gaza City hospital officials said the blast struck four Palestinians passing in a taxi. Mahmoud Abu Ikmail was in serious condition while his son Mohammed 5 daughter Karimeh 10 and mother-in-law Turkiya 60 were also hurt. </P> <P> Brig. Salem Abu Omar a PLO officer said at least one PLO police colonel was lightly injured. Omar said the bomber apparently slipped past while police were blocking several busloads of Palestinian from entering the intersection to hold a protest. </P> <P> At a downtown Gaza City rally Islamic Jihad leader Sheik Abdullah Shami said the suicide attack was in retaliation for the death of Hani Abed an Islamic Jihad leader killed by a car bomb Nov. 2. Palestinians blamed the bombing on Israel. </P> <P> A group of men at the rally wore white sheets and hoods to signify their willingness to carry out future suicide attacks. </P> <P> An Islamic Jihad leaflet identified the bomber as Hisham Ismail Hamad 21 of Abed's Sheikh Radwan neighborhood in Gaza City. </P> <P> ``This heroic operation is part of a series of operations that (we) will carry out as an immediate and quick reaction to the martyrdom of Hani Abed. We will attack all Israelis in all Palestine including Israel '' the leaflet said. </P> <P> At the rally of 3 000 outside Abed's house masked men fired automatic rifles and the announcer bellowed: ``This is one of our first responses in answer to the death of Hani Abed.'' </P> <P> Islamic Jihad or Holy War is the smallest and most violent of the Islamic militant groups opposed to the Israel-PLO accord. It is led by Fatih Shikaki a doctor based in Lebanon and Syria and reportedly gets support from Iran. </P> <P> The explosion occurred in an area of the Gaza Strip still controlled by Israeli forces. The army pulled out of most of the strip when the PLO took over in May. </P> <P> The army stayed in the location to protect Netzarim an isolated Jewish settlement about 200 meters down the road. From Netzarim with 180 residents the outskirts of Gaza City with its 300 000 Palestinian residents are clearly visible. </P> <P> Israeli troops and PLO police gather at the junction for joint patrols. Leaflets after Abed's death threatened to attack a joint Israel-PLO patrol. </P> <P> ``We heard a tremendous boom and smoke above the junction '' said Haim Yifrah a Netzarim resident nearby at the time of the attack. Blood stains were splattered across the roads afterwards. </P> <P> Israeli opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu called for halting peace talks with the Palestinians on extending the six-month-old Gaza-Jericho autonomy to the West Bank. </P> <P> ``The first thing is to stop the process that leads to giving them more territory '' he said on Israel radio. ``The terror is meant to bring about more Israeli concessions to achieve the common goal of (PLO leader Yasser) Arafat and Hamas to destroy Israel.'' </P> <P> But government officials said stopping the talks is exactly the aim of such bloodshed. </P> <P> ``There's no reason for Israel to succumb to the terror and give them what they want '' said Health Minister Ephraim Sneh. He said that with Islamic fundamentalists Israel ``will deal in the only language they know which is the language of strength.'' </P> <P> Faisal Husseini a top Palestinian official deplored the attack. He warned stopping peace talks ``will make the situation the situation even worse than it is.'' </P> <P> Islamic militants have carried out a series of attacks against Israeli targets in the past month. </P> <P> On Oct. 19 a bomb went off on a bus in central Tel Aviv killing 22. The attack was claimed by the Islamic fundamentalist movement Hamas. Two people were killed Oct. 9 when Hamas gunmen staged a shooting spree in a Jerusalem cafe district. </P> <P> Also last month a Hamas squad kidnapped an Israeli soldier. In a failed attempt to rescue him Oct. 14 an Israeli commando the hostage and three captors were killed. </P>,Lebanon,Israel,0.000894491, , ,

APW_ENG_19941111.0431,9/23/2005, <P> The U.S. decision to stop enforcing the Bosnian arms embargo will have more implications for the Western alliance than for the Muslim-led government forces who have been receiving weapons and ammunition for months. </P> <P> The United States and Europe have often been at odds during the 31-month Bosnian war and now threaten to pull apart again. Arms dealers could try even harder to breach the embargo and sell weapons. </P> <P> The United States said it would stop enforcing the arms embargo against the Muslim-led Bosnian government Saturday under a new defense bill prohibiting U.S. funding for the effort. The United States also is seeking to have the U.N. Security Council lift the arms embargo imposed on the countries of former Yugoslavia in 1991. </P> <P> Allies notably Britain and France argue that more weapons mean more fighting that would endanger their peacekeepers in Bosnia. </P> <P> The U.S. decision means that three American ships in a 19-warship flotilla patrolling the Adriatic Sea will not intercept ships carrying weapons bound for Bosnia. </P> <P> One exception will be ships found carrying heavy weapons such as surface-to-air missiles which would be viewed as a threat to NATO planes enforcing the ``no-fly zone'' over Bosnia. </P> <P> The United States will also no longer share intelligence on arms bound for Bosnia. </P> <P> The new limits on U.S. participation in the Adriatic monitoring were expected to have little effect. </P> <P> Most of the foreign munitions reaching the Bosnians are believed to come via one of Croatia's 50 airfields which range from large airports like Zagreb and Split to small grassy strips. They then make their way to Bosnia either by land or in small boats which skirt Croatia's nook-and-cranny coastline. </P> <P> NATO has no authority to challenge boats traveling from one Croatian port to another a spokesman said. Only four of more than 3 000 ships inspected or diverted since the Adriatic patrols began in November 1992 have been found carrying weapons for Bosnia. </P> <P> ``The only area where the Americans are actively involved is in policing the Adriatic and that's an area where nobody goes through anymore '' said Paul Beaver a Balkans military analyst for Jane's Information Group of defense journals in London. </P> <P> Bosnia's government began receiving weapons and ammunition in significant amounts after it joined in a U.S.-brokered federation with Bosnia's Croats in March. The federation opened the weapons smuggling route from Croatia and the sea. </P> <P> In addition the Bosnians have been building a large airfield near government-held Visoko north of Sarajevo which army sources have said is to receive munitions shipments. </P> <P> Breaches of the arms embargo are as old as the war in former Yugoslavia but military analysts such as Beaver noted a marked increase in deliveries of weapons and raw materials after the federation formed. </P> <P> Such deliveries many confirmed by senior Bosnian Army officials have included sophisticated Chinese- and Soviet-built wire-guided anti-tank missile systems U.S.-designed Stinger anti-aircraft missiles multiple rocket-launcher systems mortars and automatic weapons. </P> <P> Most of the weapons apparently were bought with money from Muslim countries notably Iran and Saudi Arabia analysts say. </P> <P> Fran Visnar a Croatian military analyst said the U.S. action could be a two-edged sword if its decision is interpreted as a de-facto lifting of the arms embargo. Russia a traditional ally of Serbia could start openly arming Bosnian Serbs he said. </P> <P> ``The decision itself is a dangerous one because it means that the world superpower has decided to let things develop in their own way without controlling the war through the embargo '' Visnar said. </P> <P> It was not clear what effect the U.S. decision would have on the overall Adriatic monitoring operation known as ``Operation Sharp Guard.'' </P> <P> The 11-nation patrol conducted by NATO and the West European Union also enforces the economic embargo on the former Yugoslavia. </P>,France,Serbia; Croatia,0.5,-0.5,0.002412446, 
APW_ENG_19941111.0436,1/6/2005, <P> Serb troops bombarded Mostar and other frontlines in the southwest Friday amid warnings that U.S. moves to ease the arms embargo on Bosnia could lead to more fighting and chaos. </P> <P> One girl was killed and five or six other children were wounded by a shell that hit near Mostar's heavily damaged Roman Catholic cathedral said Dragan Gajic a spokesman for the European Union which administers part of the badly damaged city. Croatian TV which showed scenes of the cathedral's bloodstained floor said a second died at a hospital. </P> <P> About 50 children were attending catechism when tragedy struck said a priest quoted by the Croatian news agency HINA. </P> <P> U.N. Spanish peacekeepers in the area said they had no confirmation where the shell came from. But at least some shells that hit Mostar on Friday were from Serb positions a spokesman said. </P> <P> In Pale the Sarajevo suburb used as the Bosnian Serb capital Serb leader Radovan Karadzic wrested formal power from his self-styled parliament to act alone in waging war. </P> <P> The decision stopped short of proclaiming martial law. Karadzic said details would be worked out and decided later by the assembly. </P> <P> That suggested many in the assembly were reluctant to put themselves under the authority of the extremist Karadzic. The Bosnian Serbs have become increasingly isolated since Serbia cut off fuel and other supplies in August. </P> <P> But fighting has flared since a joint Muslim-Croat force last week captured the city of Kupres in the biggest single Serb defeat of the war. </P> <P> The Serbs pounded frontlines Friday throughout western Bosnia-Herzegovina. </P> <P> The Bosnian government army's Fourth Corps responsible for that region called it the heaviest shelling since the early stages of the war. </P> <P> The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA claimed however that it was government forces on the offensive in at least part of the area. Nevesinje a Serb-held town southwest of Mostar and other Serb villages were under artillery fire it said. There was no independent confirmation. </P> <P> Demilitarized zones of Mostar divided into western Croat and eastern Muslim halves came under fierce shelling from Bosnian Serb positions Friday afternoon according to residents. U.N. troops confirmed some shells came from Serb guns. </P> <P> Schools were closed and civilians ordered to stay indoors along a 40-mile stretch of frontlines from Stolac south of Mostar north to Konjic Sarajevo radio said. </P> <P> The bombardment in the southwest followed a similar punishing assault Thursday on the northwestern enclave of Bihac where Muslim-led government troops had made significant gains in recent weeks. </P> <P> Two people were killed and 10 wounded in two villages just south of Bihac city said Maj. Mohammed Bashir a U.N. spokesman. </P> <P> Much of the shelling came from Serb-held territory in neighboring Croatia he said. </P> <P> Several U.N. officials said they had heard the Croatian Serbs were massing troops near the fighting but had no confirmation that they had crossed into Bosnia. </P> <P> European governments voiced consternation at news that the United States will stop enforcing the international arms embargo against the Muslim-led Bosnian government. It is part of an embargo imposed on all former Yugoslavia in 1991 when war was raging in Croatia. </P> <P> ``The lifting of the arms embargo is regrettable and promises a dangerous escalation of the conflict. It is like pouring oil on to a burning fire '' said David Clark a spokesman for Britain's opposition Labor Party. </P> <P> Warned Alexander Dzasokhov a member of the foreign affairs committe of Russia's parliament: ``It's fraught with further military escalation.'' </P> <P> British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called the U.S. decision ``a worrying problem.'' Officials of the Western European Union said the move was divisive. </P> <P> The decision means that three U.S. ships that are part of a 19-ship flotilla in the Adriatic will no longer stop or divert ships suspected of carrying arms to Bosnia. It was not immediately clear what effect the U.S. decision will have on the overall monitoring. </P> <P> In Serb-dominated Yugoslavia Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said the decision was ``the last drop in the glass'' of America's siding with one party in the Bosnian war according to the Tanjug news agency. </P> <P> Also Friday the independent newspaper Borba in Belgrade reported that Yugoslavia plans to resettle as many as 100 000 Serb refugees in Kosovo province where 90 percent of the population of 1.9 million is Albanian. </P> <P> The move is certain to fan tensions in Kosovo where nearly every Albanian political party wants independence. Serbia has tried in vain to entice Serbs to move there in hopes of changing Kosovo's ethnic makeup. </P>,Serbia,Croatia,0.699999988,-0.300000012,0.002910516, 
APW_ENG_19941111.0440,5/19/2004, <P> CHICAGO (AP) - Soybeans futures prices ended sharply lower and grains fell in sympathy Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade after investors bailed out of the soybean oil market. </P> <P> Grains and soybeans futures had been supported by a surge this week in soybean oil prices that came from sharply higher overseas prices of palm and other vegetable oils. </P> <P> But after soybean oil futures failed to break through a key psychological resistance point late in the session investors began to sell. </P> <P> ``When the oil broke the rest of the floor followed suit and everything sold off '' said Victor Lespinasse assistant vice president for grains at Dean Witter Discover and Co. in Chicago. </P> <P> Wheat futures prices also faced pressure throughout the day on slim export prospects.

Delaitre beat Swede Jonas Bjorkman with a straightforward 6-3 6-3. </P> <P> Defending champion Sampras will face the winner of the match between sixth-seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia and American Jared Palmer who play late Friday. </P> <P> Sampras broke serve twice and hardly broke a sweat against Black ranked 76th in the world winning the first set in barely 20 minutes. </P> <P> Black who only was invited into the tournament after Boris Becker was a late no-show briefly livened up the evening breaking Sampras early in the second set. To no avail Sampras still prevailed 6-3 to win in one hour. </P> <P> ``I'm playing a little bit better each match '' said Sampras who was slowed by a throat infection early in the week. </P> <P> After saving six matchpoints and struggling through two tiebreaks on Thursday before beating Cedric Pioline Larsson the world's No. 22 made it one better and took on three tiebreaks Friday. </P> <P> ``You can never give up and again I was lucky to win '' said Larsson. </P> <P> Experience -- and an array of great backcourt drives -- were finally too much for the Canadian who belied his world ranking of 123 throughout the week. Lareau 21 beat second seed Michael Stich in the first round. </P> <P> ``If you lose 7-6 in the third set it hurts a lot more '' said Lareau. </P> <P> In the first set Larsson imposed himself only in the tiebreak when the pressure got to Lareau. </P> <P> The players exchanged service breaks early on in the second and Larsson was two points from the match in the tenth game. But Lareau sent the set into another tiebreaker producing two aces to keep the Swede at bay. </P> <P> In the decider Lareau came out on top 7-5 to the delight of the 5 000 fans at the Sports Palace. </P> <P> The third set produced more of the same Larsson often scoring with drives from the backcourt while Lareau stayed even with winners at the net. When Lareau was two points from the match in the 10th game it was Larsson's turn to reply and an ace and a forehand drive kept him alive until the final tiebreak. </P> <P> One of his many great service returns finally gave the Swede the match. </P> <P> Delaitre ranked 64th in the world had an easy passage into the semifinal when Bjorkman showed little of the aggression that had marked his good run at the tournament. </P> <P> Without any problem Delaitre slowed down play with lots of slices drawing Bjorkman into many easy misses. ``I thought he would come to the net a lot more. Instead he just let me impose play '' he said. </P> <P> After his upset of No. 4 seed Richard Krajicek in the opening round the Frenchman hasn't looked back. </P> <P> ``I feel no pressure whatsoever.

APW_ENG_19941111.0452,1/17/2004, <P> The ``yes'' and ``no'' sides in Sweden's European Union campaign pulled even in opinion polls Friday with pollsters saying final TV debates may be decisive for Sunday's referendum on membership. </P> <P> But leaders from both camps exchanged mostly barbs and flurries of statistics in a televised panel discussion that seemed to blur rather than clarify the issues. </P> <P> ``You want us to be lobbyists in the union rather than members '' Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson charged at one point in the debate. </P> <P> ``I wouldn't wish that on anybody not even you '' responded Kenth Pettersson a leader of the anti-EU campaign. </P> <P> The referendum has attracted attention across Europe. Foreign Ministry officials said a record number of foreign journalists -- 400 reporters including 30 TV crews -- have arrived to cover the balloting. </P> <P> Sweden's result Sunday likely will influence voters in neighboring Norway which is holding its referendum Nov. 28. Finland voted ``yes'' last month. Austria approved membership in June. </P> <P> If all four join the EU will grow to 16 members encompassing about 375 million people. </P> <P> Supporters said rejection could be disastrous for Sweden. Anti-EU campaigners accused them of trying to scare voters into saying ``yes'' in the non-binding referendum. </P> <P> ``We have nothing against international organizations but this is a project to create a new state in Western Europe '' said Per Gahrton a parliamentarian and leader of Sweden's Green Party. </P> <P> With only two days left both sides were growing tense as polls showed supporters and opponents neck and neck. Up to 20 percent remained undecided setting the stage for a suspenseful vote. </P> <P> A poll by the Temo institute published in the daily Dagens Nyheter said 40 percent favored membership and 40 percent were against. The survey Nov. 2-9 included interviews with 1 022 people. No margin of error was given. </P> <P> Another poll by the SIFO institute and published in the Goteborgs-Posten newspaper showed the number of supporters rising to 42 percent compared with 40 percent a week earlier national radio reported. </P> <P> The number of opponents had dropped to 39 percent from 42 percent. SIFO said 17 percent remained undecided. The poll of 1 400 people had a margin of error of three percentage points the radio said. </P> <P> The slight edge for supporters was within the margin of error. But the trend was confirmed by earlier polls. </P> <P> Voters parties and unions were deeply divided. The chiefs of the two unions representing the large public sector came out in favor of the EU but they refrained from pushing their divided memberships to follow suit. </P> <P> EU critics say membership will cost Sweden jobs and sovereignty. Many focus on the perceived threat to Sweden's strict environmental protection laws which must eventually be brought in line with those in the EU. </P> <P> Sweden has been granted a four-year exemption on some policies. Supporters say that's enough time to push the EU to raise its standards. Critics call it a gamble. </P> <P> ``The union could adapt to our laws of course. That could happen in some cases. But not all '' Gahrton told reporters. He said the main problem would be a loss of influence for Sweden's smaller parties as decision-making moves to Brussels. </P> <P> ``This is an anti-democratic revolution '' Gahrton said. </P> <P> Jan Viklund an anti-EU campaigner standing at a booth in downtown Stockholm said many lower-income voters tend to fear for their jobs and the little say they have in politics. </P> <P> ``It's the same in all European countries '' he said. ``People in the upper and middle classes are in favor and people in the lower classes are against.'' </P>,Sweden,Austria; Norway; Finland,1.799999952,0.169161767, ,

Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. </P> <P> The final results will probably leave the governing Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) with 50 percent of the vote and the Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) rebels with about 40 percent he said. </P> <P> President Joaquim Chissano had 60 percent of the votes for president compared to 30 percent for Afonso Dhlakama head of RENAMO. </P> <P> Almost 6 million people voted in the election considered the southeast African nation's best chance to leave behind a legacy of war dating back almost to independence from Portugal in 1975. </P> <P> Although RENAMO has repeatedly claimed widespread fraud during the Oct. 27-29 voting and threatened to reject the result raising fears of a possible return to warfare as occurred in Angola two years ago. </P> <P> Raul Domingos chief RENAMO negotiator said Friday that returning to war was no longer an option after two years of relative calm following a 1992 peace pact that set up the election. </P> <P> The U.N.

APW_ENG_19941111.0474,4/27/2004, <P> Pete Sampras is reaching peak form for next week's world championship and outplayed Byron Black of Zimbabwe 6-1 6-3 Friday to reach the semifinals of the dlrs 1.1 million European Community Championship. </P> <P> Barring his way to Sunday's final is fellow-American Jared Palmer ranked 48th in the world who beat sixth-seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia 6-4 6-4. </P> <P> Seventh-seeded Magnus Larsson survived his second deciding tiebreak in as many days to set up a surprise semifinal Saturday against France's Olivier Delaitre. </P> <P> Larsson struggled through three tiebreaks to end the unlikely challenge of Canadian qualifier Sebastien Lareau 7-6 (7-3) 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-5). Delaitre beat Swede Jonas Bjorkman with a straightforward 6-3 6-3. </P> <P> Sampras broke serve twice and hardly broke a sweat against Black ranked 76th in the world winning the first set in barely 20 minutes. </P> <P> Black who only was invited into the tournament after Boris Becker was a late no-show briefly livened up the evening breaking Sampras early in the second set. To no avail Sampras still prevailed 6-3 to win in one hour. </P> <P> ``I'm playing a little bit better each match '' said Sampras who was slowed by a throat infection early in the week. </P> <P> Palmer upset Rafter by taking the game away from him at the net an area where the Australian is usually dominant. ``I just kept coming at him '' said Palmer. And when he stayed back a couple of key passing shots frustrated the Australian further. </P> <P> He threw his racket in disgust when he failed to control a volley that provided the deciding break for Palmer. </P> <P> After saving six matchpoints and struggling through two tiebreaks on Thursday before beating Cedric Pioline Larsson the world's No. 22 made it one better and took on three tiebreaks Friday. </P> <P> ``You can never give up and again I was lucky to win '' said Larsson. </P> <P> Experience -- and an array of great backcourt drives -- were finally too much for the Canadian who belied his world ranking of 123 throughout the week. Lareau 21 beat second seed Michael Stich in the first round. </P> <P> ``If you lose 7-6 in the third set it hurts a lot more '' said Lareau. </P> <P> In the first set Larsson imposed himself only in the tiebreak when the pressure got to Lareau. </P> <P> The players exchanged service breaks early on in the second and Larsson was two points from the match in the tenth game. But Lareau sent the set into another tiebreaker producing two aces to keep the Swede at bay. </P> <P> In the decider Lareau came out on top 7-5 to the delight of the 5 000 fans at the Sports Palace. </P> <P> The third set produced more of the same Larsson often scoring with drives from the backcourt while Lareau stayed even with winners at the net. When Lareau was two points from the match in the 10th game it was Larsson's turn to reply and an ace and a forehand drive kept him alive until the final tiebreak. </P> <P> One of his many great service returns finally gave the Swede the match. </P> <P> Delaitre ranked 64th in the world had an easy passage into the semifinal when Bjorkman showed little of the aggression that had marked his good run at the tournament. </P> <P> Without any problem Delaitre slowed down play with lots of slices drawing Bjorkman into many easy misses. ``I thought he would come to the net a lot more. Instead he just let me impose play '' he said. </P> <P> After his upset of No. 4 seed Richard Krajicek in the opening round the Frenchman hasn't looked back. </P> <P> ``I feel no pressure whatsoever. Soon I'll be on holiday anyhow '' he said of his season-ending tournament. </P>,Zimbabwe,Australia; France,0.400000006,-0.400000006,0.014480263,

APW_ENG_19941112.0042,9/22/2005, <P> From an American teen-ager flogged in Singapore through the Korean nuclear crisis to reconciliation between America and Vietnam it has been a tumultuous year for East and West since the twain last met. </P> <P> A year ago the scene was Seattle where President Clinton joined leaders of the Pacific rim nations in a historic summit that came to grips with the changed geopolitical map of the post-Cold War world. </P> <P> By choosing Indonesia for their second summit this coming week the 18 member governments of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum have brought the transformation full circle. </P> <P> Indonesia was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement a group that epitomized the Third World and its festering resentment toward Western wealth and political supremacy. </P> <P> The country Clinton is coming to on Sunday attests to a new reality: of skyscrapers highways science parks aircraft factories and glittering shopping malls. </P> <P> Only two years ago Indonesia was still a non-aligned stalwart playing host to the movement's 1992 summit. But already then leaders like Malaysia's Mahathir Mohamad were asking an obvious question: With superpower rivalry dead with whom do you non-align? </P> <P> APEC doesn't claim to be the answer. It is punctilious about sticking to economics and shunning politics. It is not a European Union-type bloc nor an imitation North American Free Trade Agreement. Its members are as diverse as China and Chile Brunei and New Zealand the United States and Papua New Guinea. </P> <P> But ill-defined as the Asia-Pacific concept might be the Jakarta summit serves to focus the mind on the often prickly interplay between East and West. </P> <P> A touchstone for what has been called ``the clash of civilizations'' came this year in 18-year-old Michael Fay the American teen-ager who was lashed on the buttocks in a Singapore jail for spraying paint on cars. </P> <P> Washington's protests and Singapore's vigorous defense of its penal code set off a furious cross-Pacific debate about the merits of Western liberalism vs. Confucian discipline. Americans looked at Singapore and saw a well-ordered but stifling autocracy; Singaporeans looked at America and saw social decay. </P> <P> In Hong Kong Britain has waged a battle of wills with China to install democracy as a last bequest to the colony before it reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. Limited though the new democracy is China sees it as a plot to impose alien Western values. </P> <P> Malaysia's Mahathir and Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating waged a bitter personal feud over Mahathir's resentment of institutions like APEC which in his view give Western English-speaking countries too much weight in Asia. </P> <P> The United States' advocacy of human rights has also caused cultural strains with countries like China Singapore and Indonesia arguing that human rights as perceived in the West are not always applicable in Asia. </P> <P> Thus a collective sigh of relief went up in June when the Clinton administration in an abrupt climbdown severed the link between China's trade privileges and its human rights record. </P> <P> Another happy moment came when the United States lifted its trade embargo on Vietnam which like China is marrying its communist system to the free market and applying for observer status in APEC. </P> <P> American veterans of the Vietnam War now tour their old battlefields and next month the United States expects to regain ownership of the Saigon embassy building it abandoned in the final act of that conflict. </P> <P> Washington's role as Asia's power broker remains evident in the dispute over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program. </P> <P> It has struck a deal whereby North Korea will get aid and U.S. diplomatic recognition in return for freezing its nuclear program and opening it to U.N. inspection. </P> <P> But South Korea frets that Washington has given away too much and if the North Koreans renege on the deal U.S. credibility in Asia will be severely tested. </P> <P> Asia's attitude to the U.S. defense umbrella is flawed and ambivalent Felix Soh foreign editor of the Straits Times in Singapore wrote Friday. </P> <P> He pointed out that despite the huge American military presence in the Pacific ``there remain skeptics who are unpersuaded about America security commitment.'' </P> <P> Yet when Washington sought recently to deepen that commitment by prepositioning hardware on ships anchored off Southeast Asian states it got a frosty response. </P> <P> ``Show some sympathy for the Americans '' Soh wrote. ``They are damned if they do damned if they don't.'' </P>,Singapore,Guinea; China; Malaysia; Chile; Indonesia,1.299999952,0.075629614, , 
APW_ENG_19941112.0043,3/19/2006, <P> An agonizing silence fills the days of relatives and co-workers of nine Americans believed held hostage by leftist guerrillas some of them for nearly two years. </P> <P> Unlike the hostage-takers in Lebanon in the 1980s the Colombian rebels don't make repeated demands or release evidence that their captives are alive. That leaves the captives' loved ones wondering and always always waiting. </P> <P> ``We're very strong and we're coping but no family can be prepared for this '' said Susan Hargrove whose husband Tom was kidnapped Sept. 23. </P> <P> In this country with the world's highest kidnapping rate Americans are increasingly becoming targets. Six were abducted this year alone. </P> <P> The rebels lack the power to overthrow the government so they've turned to kidnapping to extort money and publicity. But in most cases they haven't demanded ransom for their American hostages. </P> <P> Peace talks between the government and the guerrillas broke off in 1992. Some observers believe the guerrillas are stockpiling Americans to force the government into reopening talks on their terms. </P> <P> When rebels took two Americans from a missionary school in central Colombia in January they demanded that the government enter peace talks. The guerrillas also protested the presence of U.S. troops who were on a training mission in western Colombia during which they helped build a school and a clinic. </P> <P> Although the U.S. soldiers left Colombia in February the two captives -- Timothy Van Dyke and Steve Welsh -- remain missing. </P> <P> The captives' families and colleagues can only wait not knowing if their loved ones are alive. </P> <P> Susan Hargrove hasn't heard from her husband's captors believed to be the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia the largest rebel group. </P> <P> Hargrove a 50-year-old native of Rotan Texas was kidnapped as he drove home from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Cali where he worked as an agriculture scientist. </P> <P> On two occasions officials told Mrs. Hargrove to pack her bags that her husband was expected to be released within minutes. The tips proved false. </P> <P> Mrs. Hargrove's two children have left college in the United States to be with her in Colombia. She spends most of her time near the phone waiting for any word on the fate of her husband. </P> <P> New Tribes Mission an evangelical group based in Sanford Fla. that works with Indian tribes has seen five of its workers including Van Dyke and Welsh disappear into the hands of Colombian rebels. </P> <P> The other three -- David Mankins Richard Tenenoff and Mark Rich an American raised in Peru -- were taken from a New Tribes compound across the Panamanian border in January 1993. </P> <P> The mens' wives were given enough time to pack suitcases for them. Then the guerrillas marched their captives into the jungle. </P> <P> Guy Sier a New Tribes official in Bogota hasn't heard from the guerrillas in almost a year. But he and his colleagues cling to the belief the men are alive. </P> <P> ``The reason we believe they are still alive is that we have heard no reliable rumors that they are not alive '' Sier said. </P>,Lebanon,Colombia; Peru,0.006207385, , , 
APW_ENG_19941112.0071,5/2/2005, <P> While Davis Love's distance off the tee is the envy of his fellow golfers he longs for the radar wedge of playing partner Fred Couples. </P> <P> ``If I could get my wedge shots as close as Freddy we'd be doing even better '' Love said. ``He's certainly got me around the greens.'' </P> <P> Love and Couples combined to go 15-under-par Friday in the second round of the World Cup of Golf giving them an 11-stroke lead going into Saturday's third round. </P> <P> Couples a winner at last week's Kapalua International is looking to make it two in a row after posting a 63 over the Hyatt Dorado Beach's east course on Friday. The Americans moved to a combined 27-under-par threatening to make a rout of the 32-team international event. </P> <P> A win here would be the third straight in this event for Couples and Love breaking a record set by Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. </P> <P> Individually Couples is two strokes ahead of Malaysia's Marimuthu Ramayah after a round that included seven birdies and a chip-in eagle from a bunker at the par-5 13th. </P> <P> Couples said that following Love off the tee helps sets his rounds in motion. </P> <P> ``He was 300-something yards off the tee and down the middle on every hole '' Couples said. ``I just follow his lead. </P> <P> ``He was 25-30 yards longer than me all day. I don't think he's used more than a wedge on any of his approaches on the par 4s.'' </P> <P> Love quickly corrected him. </P> <P> ``I used a 9-iron on the 16th '' said Love the PGA Tour's driving distance leader in 1994. </P> <P> Both players have had little problem conquering a relatively easy course. Couples was never more than an 8-iron from the green on the par-4s and played the four par-5s at 5-under. </P> <P> ``That's the strength of our game '' Couples said. ``If we drive the ball straight it becomes simply a question of making some putts. And I've been going pretty well with the putter.'' </P> <P> Sunny skies replaced rain Friday providing perfect conditions for Couples and Love to tighten the U.S. grip on the lead. After starting slowly a string of seven birdies over five holes turned a 1-stroke lead into a rout for the Americans. </P> <P> ``The fairways were still a little soggy but the course was in a lot better shape '' Love said. </P> <P> Neither player is ready to ponder breaking a record held by two of golf's greatest players. </P> <P> ``We said this week that we would just go out and have fun and just let the rest take care of itself '' Couples said. ``In the back of our minds we were aware that to win for a third straight time would be outstanding.'' </P> <P> The winners of the dlrs 1.2 million tournament will share dlrs 300 000. </P> <P> The Zimbabwe team of Mark McNulty and Tony Johnstone second at the start of the day couldn't sustain an early charge and after pulling to within 1 stroke of the lead on four straight birdies by McNulty finished the day at 14-under for the tournament just 5-under for the day and 13 strokes behind Couples and Love. </P> <P> ``It looked like they were going to zip right past after McNulty's four straight birdies but he didn't make another one until the 15th hole '' Couples said. ``If you don't drive well here you could easily shoot even par or worse.'' </P> <P> Italy also threatened early but fell back with a sluggish back nine and finished at 274 tied with Zimbabwe. </P> <P> In second place at 272 11 strokes behind were P.

APW_ENG_19941112.0086,4/28/2005, <P> U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressed sympathy for 29 students who climbed a fence into the American Embassy grounds Saturday to mark the third anniversary of a massacre in East Timor. </P> <P> ``We're going to be raising the issue of East Timor ourselves during bilateral discussions '' with Indonesian officials Christopher said. </P> <P> Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after intervening in a civil war the previous year that broke out following Portugal's abandonment of its former colony. </P> <P> The United Nations has never recognized the annexation. The United States although it recognized Indonesia's incorporation of East Timor has protested that its residents have not conducted ``a valid act of self-determination.'' </P> <P> In the 1991 massacre soldiers killed scores of unarmed civilians at Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili the capital of East Timor which shares the island of Timor with the Indonesian province of West Timor. </P> <P> A government inquiry put the death toll at around 50 with 91 injured and 57 unaccounted for. Independent sources say more than 200 died. </P> <P> The student protestors Saturday scrambled over a 2.6-meter (8 foot) perimeter fence of metal bars and were squatting under the watch of Indonesians employed as embassy guards. </P> <P> The sit-in was an embarrassment for President Suharto who hoped the meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum leaders Tuesday would allow Indonesia to shrug off its negative human rights image. </P> <P> Human rights groups say Indonesian troops have killed hundreds of pro-independence demonstrators in East Timor a charge Jakarta denies. </P> <P> Christopher was at a meeting of Pacific rim ministers and did not go to the embassy. President Clinton was expected in Jakarta for the APEC summit. </P> <P> Embassy security chief Bruce Tully said there were no plans to force the students out. </P> <P> ``We are going to stay here. This is U.S. territory. Some of our friends have been arrested '' shouted a demonstrator who identified himself as Domingos Sarmento of the ``national resistance of East Timor.'' </P> <P> He said the students were from universities in Java and Bali then was told by an embassy guard to be quiet and sit down. </P> <P> At least two demonstrators were arrested one of whom was cut while climbing over the fence Police Lt. T. Agus told The Associated Press. </P> <P> The students were among a group that arrived in the capital by train and then took taxis to the sprawling embassy compound across a park from the presidential palace. </P> <P> They moved into a parking area between the perimeter fence and an inner security building. U.S. Marines who have a guard post at the inner building could not be seen. </P> <P> Some of the protestors said they demanded the release of former guerrilla leader Jose ``Xanana'' Gusmao arrested in 1992 and serving a 20-year prison term for his role in heading an armed rebellion for a separate East Timor state. </P> <P> At the APEC conference site about 2 miles (3 kms) from the embassy Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas described the incident as ``an inconvenience to the American Embassy.'' </P> <P> ``It was obviously designed to embarrass us '' an angry Alatas said to reporters. </P> <P> In East Timor itself the anniversary passed without incident. </P> <P> Dissidents most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity said they were afraid any protest might provoke a military crackdown AP Correspondent Geoff Spencer reported from Dili. </P> <P> ``Nobody can speak. No one can demonstrate. People feel the pressure of the military all the time '' said Bishop Carlos Belo spiritual leader of East Timor's Roman Catholic majority and an outspoken critic of rule by predominantly Muslim Indonesia. </P> <P> Timor is in the Indonesian archipelago about 500 miles (800 kilometers) northwest of the Australian city of Darwin. </P>,Portugal,Indonesia,0.100000001,0.033886716, , 
APW_ENG_19941112.0092,11/27/2005, <P> Pacific rim ministers wound up a two-day conference Saturday with an appeal to speed ratification of the GATT treaty and liberalize trade in the world's fastest-growing economic region. </P> <P> The joint statement was a prelude to a summit Tuesday to be attended by President Clinton of the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. </P> <P> The statement called trade and investment liberalization ``a cornerstone of APECs identity and activity.'' </P> <P> The ministers said in the statement they were determined to demonstrate leadership by doing their best to ensure early ratification of the agreement establishing the World Trade Organization on Jan. 1 as successor to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs the world's major trade regulatory body. </P> <P> Referring chiefly to China and Taiwan the ministers urged APECs non-GATT members to hurry up and complete negotiations so they can become WTO founding members. </P> <P> China has been wrangling with the United States over joining the organization saying it already has done enough to be included. Washington says China has not opened its economy sufficiently to qualify. </P> <P> ``Ministers affirmed that these negotiations should be based on substantive and commercially meaningful commitments '' the group of ministers said in its statement -- language roughly in line with the Clinton administration's where China is concerned. </P> <P> On Friday U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the United States supports China joining the WTO but it ``has to be done on a commercially reasonable basis. </P> <P> He said China's economy was too big and growing too fast to enable China to claim it is a developing nation and therefore entitled to special consideration. </P> <P> U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher appeared confident that other APEC members would back the United States on another major point -- a proposal to sweep aside trade and investment barriers in the area by the year 2020. This is the main item on the agenda of Tuesday's summit in Bogor 37 miles (60 kilometers) south of Jakarta. </P> <P> Malaysia is openly critical of the proposal fearing that developed countries like the United States are seeking to take advantage of Asia's growing economies through APEC. </P> <P> Malaysia's trade minister Rafidah Aziz said she personally sided with the critics but was leaving the final word to her prime minister Mahathir Mohamad who will attend the summit. </P> <P> Christopher was confident however the leaders would side with the U.S. position. </P> <P> ``We in the United States hope and expect that the vision of free trade reached by 2020 will be ratified at Bogor by our leaders '' he said adding that the next step was to discuss how to meet that goal. </P> <P> Other officials have been relatively reticent and the meeting's chairman Indonesia's Coordinating Minister of Industry and Trade Hartarto would only say: ``What we need is a vision to which this Asia-Pacific is directed for future cooperation. We do agree this vision will be decided by our leaders when they meet in Bogor.'' </P> <P> APEC nations resisting a timetable have stated that they fear their economies could be overwhelmed by more developed nations. Indonesia a developing economy wants a free trade timetable for all APEC nations by 2020. </P> <P> President Suharto of Indonesia the APEC chairman is expected to propose the timetable at Tuesday's summit. </P>,China,Malaysia; Indonesia,1.200000048,0.021316303, ,

''The end of the war is close and inevitable ... UNITA must decide what shape it will take for them.'' </P> <P> Rebel leader Jonas Savimbi who had called off the peace deal as government troops overran Huambo this week reportedly told a U.S. diplomat he would sign the treaty as scheduled Tuesday in Lusaka Zambia. </P> <P> The treaty was to be cosigned by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos capping 11 months of painstaking U.N.-brokered negotiations. </P> <P> A nationwide cease-fire was to kick in two days later followed by a power-sharing deal between government and rebels. </P> <P> U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright told The Associated Press Savimbi had called her Friday and told her he would go to Lusaka. </P> <P> Asked whether Savimbi actually would sign the document Albright declined comment. But UNITA rebel spokesman Marcos Samondo told the Portuguese news agency LUSA that Savimbi had assured Albright he would sign. </P> <P> The accord hung by a thread after government troops launched a massive attack on Savimbi's capital and main base 530 kilometers (330 miles) southeast of Luanda. </P> <P> The rebels had demanded government troops pull back and claimed UNITA troops were still fighting inside city limits. </P> <P> But Angolan state TV showed footage late Friday of the Angolan flag flying over the bullet-pocked governor's palace in downtown Huambo. </P> <P> Cheering people were shown crowding around patrolling government soldiers. An army commander identified as Col. Souza told TV his troops had fought hard for 15 days but ''then took the city almost unopposed.'' </P> <P> ''The enemy has fled '' he said. </P> <P> The government mistrustful of UNITA and determined to negotiate from strength has ignored several appeals by the United Nations the pope the United States and other countries to halt the Huambo assault. </P> <P> Government military sources said they believed the rebels had split into small attack squads and filtered westward through government lines toward the Atlantic coast. </P> <P> U.N. and Zambian officials said Friday the government offered a cease-fire at last-minute talks with U.N. mediators in Lusaka the Zambian capital. </P> <P> It was not clear whether the cease-fire offer had been authorized by dos Santos. </P> <P> His spokesman Ademiro Vaz de Conceicao refused to confirm the offer saying the rebels' ``participation should not depend on the military situation on the ground.'' </P> <P> ``They began the fighting if they want to stop they should negotiate as we are '' he said. </P> <P> But the offer prompted the rebels to agree to return to talks which they had called off because of the government assault on Huambo said the U.N. officials demanding anonymity. </P> <P> Early Saturday a rebel delegation expected aboard a U.N. plane from Kinshasa Zaire still had not arrived in Lusaka. But preparations were going ahead for Tuesday's signing. </P> <P> The Presidents of Zambia South Africa and Zimbabwe planned to attend as did Salim Salim secretary general of the Organization of African Unity. </P> <P> More than half a million Angolans have died since war began on the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975 and millions are threatened by starvation and disease. </P> <P> A 1991 accord brought a brief peace but UNITA lost 1992 multiparty elections and returned to war seizing two-thirds of the country. </P> <P> Freshly armed government troops launched a counterattack last fall which has now taken them to Huambo.

Oil production amounts to 828 000 barrels of oil a day and with growing gas exports accounts for three-quarters of annual budget revenue. </P> <P> Oman is not a member of the 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. </P> <P> According to ministry figures quoted by the newspaper the sultanate expects its gas reserves to increase to 20 trillion cubic meters (700 trillion cubic feet) ``within a few years'' because of an intensive exploration drive now underway. </P> <P> Shanfari said China has already initialled a memorandum of understanding to secure supplies of Omani gas. But he gave no details. </P> <P> In September Oman signed an agreement with India on the principle terms for a long-term gas supply contract that involves laying a 700-mile-long (1 130-kilometer) underwater pipeline across the Indian Ocean. </P> <P> The dlrs 2.8 billion pipeline would supply India with one billion cubic feet (283 million cubic meters) of Omani gas a day. That would increase five-fold when a second pipeline was laid later. </P> <P> Project financing was expected to be worked out before the end of 1995. </P> <P> The India project started with the signing of a memorandum of understanding in March 1993 with the final contract signing targeted for next July. </P> <P> The new gas sales to Asia would be shipped in supertankers Shanfari noted. </P> <P> Oman is developing its gas potential to compensate for weak oil prices. </P> <P> Shanfari said he did not expect to see an increase in oil prices because these were controlled by the strategic stockpiles of the industrialized world the newspaper reported. </P> <P> Asked whether he thought Iraq's eventual return to the world market would affect prices he said that depended on agreement among OPEC member states on production levels.

He later denied them. </P> <P> Iraq a nation of some 18 million people has been badly hurt by U.N. Security Council sanctions that ban oil sales and other trade until Iraq fulfills a series of conditions including recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty. </P> <P> In his hour and 45-minute speech to the Peoples Assembly Mubarak also renewed Egypt's commitment to help advance the Middle East peace process. </P> <P> But he warned that peace will remain incomplete until Israel comes to terms with Syria and Lebanon. </P> <P> Egypt the first country to sign a peace treaty with the Jewish state in 1979 was a key mediator in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Jordan last month signed a peace treaty. </P> <P> But talks with Syria have been hung up over Syria's demand for the return of the Golan Heights captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. This has held up progress with Lebanon which is dominated by Syria. </P> <P> Mubarak also repeated Egypt's demand that the Middle East be a nuclear-free zone. Israel is the only country in the region believed to have nuclear weapons though it has never acknowledged so publicly. </P> <P> On domestic issues Mubarak praised Egyptian security forces for cracking down on Muslim extremists who have been trying to overthrow his secular government and replace it with a fundamentalist regime. </P> <P> ``The Egyptian police have dealt a heavy blow to the terrorist groups and managed to disclose their hideouts and monitor their contacts inside and outside '' Mubarak said. ``They deserve our congratulations and respect.'' </P> <P> Mubarak who has been in power since the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat was elected to a third six-year term last year. </P>,Lebanon,Egypt; Iraq; Israel; Kuwait; Jordan,0.800000012,-0.400000006,0.001767833,

APW_ENG_19941112.0278,3/20/2004, <P> It's hard to play tennis with tears in your eyes. </P> <P> Martina Navratilova so desperately wants to win her final tournament this week capture one more Virginia Slims Championship in her farewell Garden party yet it's those tears that worry her more than any player she'll face. </P> <P> ``It's all going to be so sentimental it could be overwhelming '' Navratilova said. ``I really want to do well to go out playing the way I know I can play. It would be the ultimate to go out with a win. But I'm also ready for it to be over with. There's so much going on inside me and around me that it's hard to deal with. It's going to be tough to say goodbye.'' </P> <P> There's the matter of a five-minute videotape of her career guaranteed to make her cry that will be shown on the giant screens at Madison Square Garden after she plays Tuesday night against Gabriela Sabatini. The tearjerker was planned to precede the match but Navratilova nixed that idea figuring she'd break down so much she wouldn't be able to lift her racket. Her strong image aside Navratilova is a softie at heart and one of sport's true sobbers in victory or defeat. </P> <P> There will be the courtside presence of her parents who have come especially for the occasion from their home near Prague in the Czech Republic. It was 19 years ago that she left them behind when she defected to the United States a move motivated by a yearning for freedom from communism much more than a quest for the money she would win -- more than dlrs 20 million since turning pro in 1975. </P> <P> Sitting there too will be Chris Evert her great rival and friend for two decades and Billie Jean King her mentor and motivator. </P> <P> Everywhere Navratilova turns in the Garden she will see familiar faces 15 000 of her closest friends. </P> <P> And if she doesn't fall to pieces from all that emotional weight maybe she'll also keep it together when a banner with her name is raised to the rafters alongside the retired New York Knicks jerseys and she's given a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and an 11-foot tall tennis ball with thousands of signatures from New York fans. </P> <P> That big ball worries her. ``I don't know where I'm going to put it '' she said ``and I don't want the Federal Express guy to get mad with me when he delivers it.'' </P> <P> The souvenir will wind up on her Aspen Colo. estate where she's been building a grand house for years as her retreat in retirement. </P> <P> The thing is Navratilova isn't the retiring type. Her parents have been trying to talk her out of quitting the game knowing how restless she is and how well she still can play at 38. But as always when Navratilova makes up her mind about something she's not easily dissuaded. </P> <P> Consider though Navratilova's immediate plans: -- The day after the Slims championships she's leading seven hours of WTA meetings as the organization's new president going over everything from the future of the tour to the details of the books. On the same day there is a planned announcement of her participation with Evert and others in a Legends Tour. -- On Day Two of retirement she flies to Poland to begin a month of exhibitions and charity appearances worldwide that will include trips to her Czech homeland France Italy Brazil Chile Thailand and Hong Kong. </P> <P> Along the way she'll be working on a laptop computer writing ``Feat of Clay '' the second in her planned trilogy of mystery novels. </P> <P> And what about all the skiing and relaxing Navratilova has talked about doing once she put down her racket? Well she'll cram in a few days of helicopter skiing in Canada around Christmas before charging off on more exhibitions projects and WTA work in 1995. </P> <P> CBS has talked with Navratilova about a career in broadcasting an idea that is appealing to her. But she's interested in more than tennis. Navratilova believes she can be a wide-ranging sports commentator and for the past 20 years she has been one of the most articulate and outspoken athletes in the world. </P> <P> Navratilova never has been shy about commenting on any topic whether her lesbian lifestyle her commitment to promoting gay-lesbian rights and various political issues. She campaigned against anti-gay measures in Idaho and Oregon this fall and both measures were defeated. </P> <P> ``I felt good about that '' she said. ``I plan to stay politically active.'' </P> <P> That activity and frankness have cost her millions of dollars in missed endorsements over the years plus the embarrassment of rejection by hundreds of corporate sponsors her agents have approached trying to capitalize on her 18 Grand Slam victories. </P> <P> Virtually all of those companies have been scared away from having her promote their products because they fear the backlash of a small percentage of their customers. Companies worry about any athlete who takes a controversial position much less one as touchy as homosexuality. Meanwhile many lesser players like Sabatini and Jennifer Capriati had millions in endorsements lavished on them. </P> <P> But there has been a positive flip-side to Navratilova's honesty: a genuine respect for her that has made her one of the world's most popular and esteemed athletes. Recently she was honored with an offer to join the U.N. 50th committee the only athlete along with top corporate executives diplomats and public officials who will seek to formulate broad human rights policies. </P> <P> ``I worried sometimes that I was retiring too late or that I was retiring too soon '' Navratilova said. ``But it feels just right. There was the Wimbledon final this year and that was great. Now finishing up here in New York at the Slims Championship is the perfect way to go out. I still have a lot I want to do in my life. I'm not going to be bored. I just hope I can handle all the emotion this week.'' </P>,Canada,Poland; Brazil; Italy; France; Chile; Thailand,0.000266398, , ,

The demonstrators were protesting the government's proposals to overhaul Italy's pension system one of the most generous in Europe but plagued by political patronage. ,Sweden,Austria; Norway; Finland; Italy; Israel; Indonesia; Croatia,0.699999988,0.300000012,0.003167175,

APW_ENG_19941112.0318,3/13/2004, <P> Hundreds of angry youths clashed with Indonesian riot police and rampaged through Dili early Sunday demanding independence for East Timor. </P> <P> As demonstrators spread throughout Dili burning debris stoning police and breaking store windows hundreds of riot police cordoned off the Dili East Timor's capital. </P> <P> The protests erupted two days before Asian and Pacific leaders attend a summit in Indonesia and a day after the third anniversary of a massacre in which soldiers killed scores of unarmed civilians at Santa Cruz cemetary in Dili. A government inquiry said 50 people were killed 91 injured and 57 unaccounted for. Independent sources say more than 200 died. </P> <P> Twenty-nine student protesters scaled the fence surrounding the U.S. embassy in Jakarta Indonesia's capital on Saturday to mark the anniversary and draw attention to their cause. </P> <P> The demonstrations in Dili began after a 7 a.m. Mass celebrated by Bishop Carlos Belo spiritual leader of East Timor's Roman Catholic majority. About 30 Timorese youths displayed banners and chanted in Portuguese ``Viva Clinton'' and ``Free Timor '' said Associated Press photographer Jeff Widener. </P> <P> About three hours after the early-morning rally at a Roman Catholic church hundreds of youths rampaged through Dili. At one point about 150 riot police charged a large group of protesters but turned and fled when the youths stoned them and beat them with clubs. </P> <P> About 3 kilometers (2 miles) away at least 300 youths overran the Turismo Hotel where many foreign reporters were staying. The protesters armed with clubs and sticks screamed threw rocks and made off with bottles of beer. They lit a car afire outside. </P> <P> Indonesia annexed East Timor half of the island of Timor in 1976 after intervening in a civil war that followed Portugal's withdrawal from its former colony.

APW_ENG_19941112.0329,1/16/2004, <P> Anke Huber and Mary Pierce posted impressive victories Saturday to reach the final of the dlrs 750 000 Virginia Slims of Philadelphia. </P> <P> Huber shook off a disappointing first set before beating Gabriela Sabatini 6-7 (11-13) 6-1 6-4 while the second-seeded Pierce defeated fifth-seeded Natalia Zvereva of Belarus 6-3 6-3. </P> <P> Huber gained momentum by winning the first three games of the second set and took advantage of a tired Sabatini in the third. The 19-year-old German might have had an easier time had she been able to capitalize on Sabatini's nine double-faults in the first set. </P> <P> ``I had a lot of chances before the tiebreaker '' Huber said. ``I just tried to forget everything and play my game. I played a little better than in the first set and it worked out.'' </P> <P> Sabatini broke Huber's serve to pull within 3-3 in the third set but Huber broke back in the next game and served for the match three games later. She took match point when the Argentine hit a backhand return wide. </P> <P> The sixth-seeded Huber ran Sabatini along the baseline and turned her relentless powerful forehands into winners. Sabatini seeded fourth was unable to regain momentum in the final two sets. </P> <P> ``I didn't think I was in control of the match at any moment '' Sabatini said. ``I was just defending myself and just hitting it back and not guiding the ball. ... She was just hitting everything.'' </P> <P> Huber has had perhaps the most difficult route to the final. She was stretched to three sets in Jennifer Capriati's return match in the first round and needed three sets to beat local favorite Lisa Raymond. She then beat Kimberly Po in straight sets before playing Sabatini. </P> <P> Huber ranked 13th in the world is looking for her third tournament title this year. </P> <P> ``I'm a little more confident at the moment '' Huber said. ``I won a lot of close matches. I think I already played well. I'm playing much more aggressive now and much better.'' </P> <P> Sabatini who was looking for her first tournament championship in more than two years will play Martina Navratilova on Tuesday in the first round of the season-ending Virginia Slims Championships in New York. The tournament will be Navratilova's last before retiring. </P> <P> Huber defeated Pierce in straight sets in the final of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Filderstadt Germany last month. </P> <P> ``It's going to be tough '' Huber said. ``She's a very good player and she can play unbelievably good.'' </P> <P> Pierce ranked fifth in the world has not lost a set in the tournament. But she has not won in her four previous finals this season. </P> <P> Pierce never allowed Zvereva to get into rhythm and had several easy points at the net. Pierce broke Zvereva's serve at love to take a 5-3 lead and allowed just one point in the final two games to win the first set. </P> <P> She then won the final four games in the second set and broke Zvereva's serve with a powerful forehand at match point. </P> <P> ``It's important to be mentally patient with Natalia '' Pierce said. ``Game-wise you have to take the initiative and be very aggressive -- not rally with her and give her a chance to do her shots.'' </P>,Belarus,Germany,0.100000001,-0.100000001,0.007313831,

APW_ENG_19941113.0018,12/6/2005, <P> President Clinton toured the bombed-out island fortress of Corregidor Sunday then stood before thousands of white stone crosses at a U.S. military cemetery and somberly commemorated ``one of our nation's darkest hours.'' </P> <P> Opening a five-day Asian trip that gives him a respite from political problems at home the president honored American and Allied soldiers who fought in the Pacific during World War II. </P> <P> ``The United States looks toward the Pacific not as an ocean that separates us from Asia but as an ocean that unites us with Asia '' he said at a U.S. military cemetery containing the remains of 17 206 Allied military casualties. ``We will and we must remain engaged with the Philippines -- and elsewhere.'' </P> <P> The first visit of a U.S. president to the Philippines in two decades was marred by hundreds of protesters demonstrating against U.S. influence over their country some shouting ``Clinton Out!'' and ``Yankees Go Home!'' Police used tear gas and water cannons to stop a large group of leftist activists marching toward Clinton's hotel on Saturday night. </P> <P> Clinton and his wife Hillary flew by helicopter on Sunday to Corregidor Island in Manila Bay the rocky island where thousands of Americans and Filipinos died under Japanese assaults in the early days of World War II. </P> <P> They toured the island in the company of President Fidel Ramos. </P> <P> Later Clinton spoke at the American Cemetery and Memorial the largest U.S. military graveyard outside of Arlington Cemetery in Virginia. Enscribed on marble columns at the memorial are the names of 36 279 American troops missing in action in the Pacific. </P> <P> ``We can hardly imagine today the perils that met these young men in the full bloom of their young lives '' Clinton said. </P> <P> ``This ordeal engulfed the Philippines our oldest friend in Asia '' he added. </P> <P> Under a hot sun Clinton and Ramos stood at attenton as taps were played and wreaths placed on the memorial. </P> <P> Clinton recalled Gen. Douglas MacArthur's famous line ``I shall return'' as Japanese overran the island in 1942. </P> <P> ``Freedom's last foothold seemed lost... (but) General MacArthur would return and so did freedom '' Clinton said. ``We must still stand against aggression.'' </P> <P> ``In this one of our nations darkest hours our troops and our leaders might have given up but their spirits never failed '' the president said. </P> <P> Ramos said: ``We meet today to renew our determination to triumph in our war against poverty injustice and human deprivation.'' </P> <P> ``God bless the Philippines God bless the United States '' he said. </P> <P> First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton meanwhile told Philippine relief workers the administration will forge ahead with its agenda despite a Republican landslide that left her still puzzled. </P> <P> ``I don't know yet exactly what the message from the voters was '' Mrs. Clinton said. Her remark contrasted with the president's emphasis immediately after last week's elections that voters had ``sent us a clear message -- I got it.'' </P> <P> Earlier Clinton dressed in a sports shirt and Mrs. Clinton wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat walked among the bomb-charred barracks and gun emplacements on Corregidor Island now a national park and tourist attraction. </P> <P> He stood silently for a moment at the flower-festooned Pacific War Memorial at Topside -- the highest point on the island. Then with Ramos climbed into the back of a large Army truck for the ride down a windy hilly road to look at a gun battery which sustained heavy damage. </P> <P> Clinton the first president to visit the Philippines since Gerald Ford in 1975 began his day with a jog and a breakfast meeting with American business executives. He smiled and waved off reporters who asked about Rep. Newt Gingrich's vow not to compromise with the White House when as expected the Georgia Republican becomes House Speaker next year. </P> <P> Clinton was still reeling from Tuesday's midterm elections which gave majorities in both houses of Congress and in governorships to Republicans. </P> <P> At the breakfast Clinton said his administration would announce dlrs 100 million in new U.S. support through the U.S. Export-Import bank for U.S. ventures in the Philippines according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. </P> <P> Clinton was visiting the Philippines for less than 24 hours in advance of his participation at an economic summit of Asian and Pacific leaders in Jakarta Indonesia that begins on Monday. </P> <P> Next stop on Clinton's Asian trip is Jakarta for meetings with 14 other leaders whose nations belong to the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation conference (APEC).

APW_ENG_19941113.0020,6/3/2005, <P> Thousands of East Timorese rampaged through the streets of Dili on Sunday looting shops burning cars and smashing windows in protests against Indonesian rule. </P> <P> No injuries were reported in the riot which followed a small peaceful parade demanding independence for East Timor a former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia. </P> <P> Hours earlier about 40 pro-independence activists shouted ``Viva Bill Clinton'' and ``Free Timor'' at a noisy but peaceful demonstration for human rights and independence in Dili. </P> <P> The incidents followed the third anniversary Saturday of the massacre of unarmed civilians by Indonesian troops on Nov. 12 1991. </P> <P> They also coincided with Saturday's sit-in by 29 East Timorese students who climbed over a fence and sat in the grounds of the American Embassy in Jakarta 1 500 miles to the west. The unrest comes as leaders from Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum are assembling in Jakarta for a summit scheduled to begin on Tuesday. </P> <P> As demonstrators spread through the East Timorese capital burning debris stoning police and breaking store windows hundreds of Indonesian riot police cordoned off the town of 30 000 inhabitants. The rioters were armed with clubs bricks rocks and bottles. </P> <P> At one point about 150 riot police charged the protesters but turned and fled when the youths stoned them and beat them with clubs. </P> <P> At least 300 youths overran the Turismo Hotel where many foreign reporters were staying. The protesters armed with clubs and sticks screamed threw rocks torched a car and made off with beer bottles said Associated Press photographer Jeff Widener. </P> <P> Irawan Abidin director of information at the Indonesian Foreign Ministry said he understood the violence stemmed from a brawl in a Dili market on Saturday that reportedly left three dead. </P> <P> One Timorese was stabbed to death by a group of Indonesians and two Indonesian youths were killed in retaliation Saturday the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported. </P> <P> A chronic source of friction is the feeling among East Timorese that Indonesians are moving in taking over businesses and jobs. </P> <P> The students in Jakarta who sat in at the American embassy were still on the embassy grounds Sunday morning 24 hours later. Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressed sympathy for them and the embassy said it would not force them to leave. </P> <P> The peaceful demonstrators in Dili called on Clinton to help the people of East Timor which was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 as Portugal pulled out and annexed the following year. The United Nations never recognized the annexation although the United States has. </P> <P> ``Clinton must help East Timor. We want human rights and independence '' said one protester who spoke on the condition of anonymity. </P> <P> In Sunday's peaceful protest demonstrators carried anti-Indonesian banners and the flag of the outlawed Fretlin rebel group and demanded the release of Fretlin's jailed leader. </P> <P> Their protest followed an early morning Mass of about 700 worshipers conducted by East Timor's Roman Catholic bishop Carlos Filipe Belo at his residence on Dili's palm-fringed waterfront. </P> <P> The massacre anniversary passed without incident in Dili on Saturday. Only a few police and no soldiers were on the streets where it appeared to be </P> <P> business as usual. </P> <P> Commemoration of the massacre was limited to small and low-key church services. Few people visited Santa Cruz cemetery -- the hot and dusty graveyard where the 1991 shootings took place. A government inquiry said 50 people were killed 91 were injured and 57 unaccounted for. Independent sources say more than 200 died. </P> <P> Two American journalists who were present at the cemetery massacre were arrested Saturday while trying to enter East Timor to cover the anniversary. </P> <P> Allan Nairn of Vanity Fair told the AP by telephone that he and Amy Goodman of Pacifica Radio were taken off a bus by Indonesian soldiers. They were being held at a military base in Kupang in western Timor and were told a </P> <P> senior government official was flying out to question them. </P> <P> ``I don't understand why they were detained there should not be any problem '' said Abidin the Foreign Ministry spokesman. </P> <P> Human rights groups have accused Indonesia of widespread abuses in East Timor since Indonesia invaded. </P> <P> East Timor's recently appointed military commander Col. Kiki Syahnakri admitted in an interview that the army had made heavy-handed mistakes in the past but laughed at accusations of regular human rights abuses. </P> <P> ``We are being watched by the army all the time '' said one activist who spoke on condition of anonymity. </P>,Portugal,Indonesia,0.200000003,-0.200000003,0.001189888,

APW_ENG_19941113.0035,3/31/2004, <P> Michael Schumacher is Germany's first world champion driver and the youngest Formula One champion for more than two decades. </P> <P> The feisty 25-year-old clinched the title in his Benetton-Ford despite crashing out of Sunday's Australian Grand Prix after a controversial collision with his only championship rival -- Britain's Damon Hill. The race was won by Hill's Williams-Renault teammate Nigel Mansell. </P> <P> Schumacher finished the season with 91 points and eight wins one point ahead of Hill who had six triumphs during the season. He seemed stunned that he had finally achieved his ambition. </P> <P> ``It's a dream '' he said. ``I can't really bring out my emotions or express them. It is really really satisfying.'' </P> <P> Schumacher won six of the first seven grands prix of the year and then had to hold off the surge of Williams-Renault driver Hill as things turned sour. </P> <P> He served a two-race suspension for failing to observe a black flag during the British Grand Prix at Silverstone that saw him miss the Italian and Portuguese rounds. He was then disqualified after winning the Belgian Grand Prix for allegedly having an undersized skidblock. </P> <P> ``It has been a hard weekend and a very hard race '' he said. ``There has been a big competition between Damon and myself and I think we were quite equal on the circuit.'' </P> <P> He said he was fearful his world title chance had gone after the accident. </P> <P> ``This was the worst moment -- being in the tire wall and not being able to continue and seeing my rival still driving '' he said. </P> <P> ``Then I heard on the loudspeakers that he had a problem but I wasn't sure what kind of problem. Then once I saw Mansell going round two or three times without Hill coming through then I thought `That's it'.'' </P> <P> Before Schumacher who has won 10 grands prix only two Germans had won Formula One races. </P> <P> Wolfgang von Trips won two of his 27 races but was killed in an accident in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza in 1961 while Jochen Maas' only win in 105 races came at Barcelona in 1975. </P> <P> Three other German drivers: Rolf Stommelen Stefan Bellof and Manfred Winkelhock also died in race accidents. </P> <P> Schumacher who divides his time between his hometown of Kerpen and a residence in Monte Carlo began his racing career in go-karts and drove Formula Fords and Formula 3000s before graduated to driving sports cars for Mercedes Benz. </P> <P> Schumacher had his first Formula One driver for Jordan in 1991 and has since had a meteoric rise with Benetton-Ford winning his first Formula One race -- in Belgium -- within a year. </P> <P> He finished third in the world championship in 1992 -- his first full season -- and fourth last year. </P> <P> Martin Brundle Schumacher's former teammate who finished third behind Mansell and Gerhard Berger on Sunday in a McLaren-Puegeot believes the German is a prodigious talent. </P> <P> ``He is in a class of his own '' said Brundle. ``He is something extra special.'' </P> <P> Former world champion Jackie Stewart compares Schumacher to triple world champion Ayrton Senna of Brazil who died in a crash at Imola in May. </P> <P> ``He's the natural heir to the role Senna played '' said Stewart. ``It doesn't matter what lap he's on. He's always stunningly good. He's the fittest athlete I've ever seen in Grand Prix racing.'' </P>,Belgium,Brazil; Jordan; Germany,0.000470052, , , 
APW_ENG_19941113.0040,2/10/2006, <P> At least 35 people were injured in clashes between opposition activists and government supporters as a general strike shut down Bangladesh's major cities Sunday police and witnesses said. </P> <P> The capital Dhaka and other major cities were paralyzed by the dawn-to-dusk strike called by the opposition to demand resignation of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and set up a caretaker government for immediate elections. </P> <P> Sunday's strike in the third in the past four days. </P> <P> The economy is losing nearly 1 500 million taka (dlrs 38 million) in industrial production and exports for a day's strike Salman Rahman a business leader said. </P> <P> ``We are deeply concerned over the deteriorating political situation that has laid siege to the national economy '' Rahman head of Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry said. </P> <P> Opposition activists set off dozens of crude homemade bombs in several cities across Bangladesh Sunday. They also clashed with supporters of Mrs. Zia with bombs and rocks on Saturday night that left 35 people injured in the northern towns of Sirajganj and Natore police said. </P> <P> The strike also got hold in other cities including the port town of Chittagong. </P> <P> The opposition took to the streets after Commonwealth-brokered talks broke down after the opposition rejected an offer from Mrs. Zia to share power with her government to oversee balloting. The next elections are not due until 1996. </P> <P> In a bid to resume the talks the Commonwealth envoy Sir Ninian Stephen met separately with Mrs. Zia and her arch rival Sheik Hasina Saturday. </P> <P> No details of the talks were disclosed. </P> <P> The envoy a former governor-general of Australia has been in Dhaka for one month to try to mediate a negotiated settlement of the dispute. </P> <P> The crisis began in March when all the 154 opposition lawmakers walked out from the 330-member Parliament accusing Mrs. Zia's government of vote fraud corruption and inefficiency. </P> <P> Threatening a mass resignation from the legislature the opposition lawmakers did not return to the house Saturday when it resumed its session. </P>,Bangladesh,Australia,0.899999976,-0.400000006,0.01544938,

No violence was reported and the demonstrators dispersed peacefully after several hours. </P> <P> The rally was led by the May First Movement the largest left-wing labor federation in the country. It opposes a proposal to allow the U.S. military to stockpile weapons in the Philippines that could be picked up here when its forces are quickly deployed to trouble spots in Asia and the Middle East. </P> <P> In a joint news conference at the palace Ramos said Washington has not formally requested permission to do that. But he also said his government would be ``happy to consider this.'' </P> <P> The United States is the Philippines' largest trading partner and Clinton and Ramos said they will work hard to continue that. </P> <P> Clinton denied claims by demonstrators that U.S. forces left behind toxic waste at Subic Naval Base and Clark Air Base when the sailors and soldiers abandoned them in 1992. </P> <P> In another demonstration Sunday 300 people burned a large effigy of a Pepsi bottle and asked for Clinton's help in a class-action lawsuit they have filed against Pepsico Inc. Fireworks in the effigy exploded but no injuries were reported. </P> <P> The protest against Pepsico concerns a 1992 sweepstakes fiasco that saw thousands of people buy Pepsis with the winning number inside the bottle cap. Pepsi said a computer glitch had duplicated the number and it refused to pay them. </P> <P> In addition to suing Pepsi the Filipinos have asked consumers to boycott its products. In February a man who filed his own lawsuit won a decision from a regional court ordering Pepsi to pay him dlrs 39 285 but the company is appealing the ruling. </P> <P> Clinton who arrived Saturday night will fly to Indonesia to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum on Monday. </P>,Philippines,Indonesia,0.100000001,0.003552209, ,

APW_ENG_19941113.0088,12/14/2004, <P> President Clinton sought to assure world leaders on Sunday that his party's severe losses in midterm elections won't undercut his foreign policy particularly on issues like trade that have wide support. </P> <P> ``I believe that the position of the United States is just as strong as it ever has been '' Clinton said during a joint news conference with Philippine President Fidel Ramos. </P> <P> Earlier Clinton honored American and Filipino troops who died defending ``freedom's last foothold'' in World War II touring the bombed-out fortress of Corregidor Island in Manila Bay and with a speech at a U.S. military cemetery. </P> <P> Then he turned his attention to expanding trade with Asian's economic powerhouses -- the subject of economic talks that begin Monday in Jakarta Indonesia with Asian and Pacific leaders. </P> <P> Asked if he would press the issue of human rights in meetings with the leaders of China and Indonesia two nations accused of human rights abuses Clinton said: ``Absolutely.'' </P> <P> ``Human rights is too important (an issue) particularly now to pass by '' he said. </P> <P> Clinton found that he could not leave domestic politics behind. </P> <P> Asked if last Tuesday's elections -- which delivered both chambers of Congress to Republicans for the first time in 40 years -- would make it harder for him to exert influence on the world stage Clinton said: </P> <P> ``The foreign policies I have pursued particularly the mission I'm now on have enjoyed wide bipartisan support among centrists in both parties.'' </P> <P> Clinton stressed that the United States did not have a parliamentary system of government and that the constitutional power vested in the president to conduct foreign affairs ``is quite clear.'' </P> <P> Asked if he could work with Republicans especially outspoken Rep. Newt Gingrich the Republican in line to be the next leader of the House of Representatives. Clinton said he could. And Clinton denied a suggestion that his own policies are too far to the left. </P> <P> Ramos held open the door to continued U.S.-Philippine military cooperation even though U.S. influence over the country was the cause for angry demonstrations during Clinton's visit. </P> <P> ``We would like to be closely related with the United States'' on mutual security arrangements Ramos said saying his nation ``has a lot to gain.'' </P> <P> He said the Philippines would continue servicing U.S. warships. On the related issue of establishing floating depots for U.S. ships Ramos said: ``We have not seen any formal proposals in regards to such an arrangement.'' </P> <P> Clinton denied the United States had been dragging its feet in environmental cleanup after closing is sprawling naval base at Subic Bay and Clark Air Force Base in 1992 after the Philippine government refused to renew the lease. </P> <P> ``I don't think I can commit at this moment on further expenditures '' he said. </P> <P> ``The United States looks toward the Pacific not as an ocean that separates us from Asia but as an ocean that unites us with Asia '' Clinton said earlier Sunday at a wreath-laying ceremony at a U.S. cemetery containing the remains of 17 206 Allied military casualties. </P> <P> At a state luncheon Clinton was handed a saxophone and joined the band in swinging renditions of ``Georgia Brown '' ``Take the A Train '' and ``Summertime.'' ``It was a great show by the president '' Ramos said. Responded Clinton: ``I enjoyed it. They're a great band.'' </P> <P> Clinton was the first U.S. president to visit the Philippines since Gerald Ford in 1975 but his visit was marred by angry demonstrations protesting U.S. influence over the archipelago. </P> <P> Police used tear gas and water cannons to stop a large group of leftist activists marching toward Clinton's hotel on Saturday night; and hundreds of leftists shouting ``death to imperialism'' burned American flags near the palace Sunday. They dispersed peacefully after police blocked their path. </P> <P> Clinton's next stop was Jakarta Indonesia where he will attend an economic summit of Asian and Pacific leaders. The United States wants the conference to set the year 2020 as a goal for open and free trade throughout the Pacific. But China and Malaysia are resisting the proposal. </P> <P> State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said Asian leaders who have met with Secretary of State Warren Christopher in advance of the heads-of-state meeting in Jakarta expressed near-universal concern about the impact of the elections on U.S. foreign policy. </P> <P> He said Christopher had sought to assure the Asian leaders that there will be continuity in foreign policy and that this will be one of Clinton's missions in the coming days as well. </P> <P> ``Part of this is reassurance. They need to hear that '' McCurry said. </P> <P> Meanwhile First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told Philippine relief workers the administration will forge ahead with its agenda despite a Republican landslide that left her still puzzled. </P> <P> ``I don't know yet exactly what the message from the voters was '' Mrs. Clinton said.

The Fokker 27 was on a domestic flight between Algiers and the southern city of Quargla when it was detoured to the Spanish island in the Mediterranean. The identity of the hijackers was not immediately known nor was it clear what demands they were making. Airport officials allowed a journalist to go aboard as a mediator. Officials said the hijackers also released one passenger who was sick. Algerian officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the government had set up a crisis team to deal with the incident. MANILA Philippines (AP) -- President Clinton sought to assure world leaders on Sunday that his party's severe losses in midterm elections won't undercut his foreign policy particularly on issues like trade that have wide support. ``I believe that the position of the United States is just as strong as it ever has been '' Clinton said during a joint news conference with Philippine President Fidel Ramos. Earlier Clinton honored American and Filipino troops who died defending ``freedom's last foothold'' in World War II touring the bombed-out fortress of Corregidor Island in Manila Bay and with a speech at a U.S. military cemetery. LUSAKA Zambia (AP) -- Zambian officials pressed ahead Sunday with plans to host an Angolan peace treaty ceremony after receiving assurances from rebel leader Jonas Savimbi that he would come to sign the truce. Savimbi's participation had been in doubt after government troops overran his stronghold last week. The government attack on rebel headquaurters at Huambo had threatened U.N.-mediated efforts to end 19 years of civil war. Savimbi's UNITA rebels seemed to have conceded that with their defeat at Huambo. DILI Indonesia (AP) -- Thousands of East Timorese rampaged through the streets of Dili on Sunday looting shops burning cars and smashing windows in protests against Indonesian rule. No injuries were reported in the riot which followed a small peaceful parade demanding independence for East Timor a former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia. Hours earlier about 40 pro-independence activists shouted ``Viva Bill Clinton'' and ``Free Timor'' at a noisy but peaceful demonstration for human rights and independence in Dili. The incidents followed the third anniversary Saturday of the massacre of unarmed civilians by Indonesian troops on Nov. 12 1991. MAPUTO Mozambique (AP) -- Rebels turned politicians were gaining as counting continued in Mozambique's first multiparty election.

APW_ENG_19941113.0107,12/21/2005, <P> U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was pessimistic Sunday about China`s chances of beating the Jan. 1 target deadline for joining the World Trade Organization. </P> <P> But in separate remarks he dropped a broad hint that negotiations will be announced next month on Chile's application to join the North American Free Trade Agreement. </P> <P> The developments came during a weekend of intensive trade talks among the 18 members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum which on Tuesday will hold a summit in Indonesia to be attended by President Clinton. </P> <P> After a 2 1/2-hour meeting between Kantor and Chinese Trade Minister Wu Yi strains were evident over China's demand to join the World Trade Organization as a founding member and Washington's insistence that it bring its economy more into line with other major trading nations. </P> <P> ``I am not persuaded that we can finish our negotiations by the end of the year. But we will make every effort '' Kantor said. </P> <P> The World Trade Organization will replace the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs at the start of 1995 after the terms are ratified by parliaments of the member governments. </P> <P> China maintains that it is a developing country and as such has met the terms for membership. </P> <P> The United States says China's economy is too big and its growth too strong for it to be called a developing country. It wants China to offer more market access and other concessions in line with the free-trade goals of the WTO. </P> <P> Kantor said U.S. and Chinese officials would meet in Geneva early next month to pursue a deal. </P> <P> ``The pace of progress depends on China. They know exactly what is necessary '' he said. But Wu who emerged sounding disappointed said it was not ``a one-way street.'' </P> <P> ``We think we have arrived at the time to resolve the accession (to the WTO) '' she said. ``But whether we can do it or not isn't only up to us.'' </P> <P> Kantor said the overwhelming majority of the 20-nation working committee on WTO membership ``support the U.S. position that China's offer at this point is not adequate.'' </P> <P> Washington wants a range of commitments from China to reform its currency and market laws in line with free-trade principles. </P> <P> Kantor said the United States wanted to ensure that ``we break down barriers and make rules fair and that China begins to adhere to the regime that all the trading nations in the world have agreed to.'' </P> <P> Meanwhile U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said the U.S. policy of seeking business in China will help speed progress in human rights there although gradually. </P> <P> In a speech Sunday in Jakarta Brown said: ``We have a much better chance of positively affecting human rights in China if we are commercially engaged rather than disengaged.'' </P> <P> However speaking to reporters after his speech Brown said: ``I don't make any grandiose claims that it is going to improve immediately. ... It is going to take some time to see an improvement.'' </P> <P> Chilean Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia Hurtado said he expects the Clinton administration to announce the formal start of negotiations with Chile over its NAFTA membership at next month's Summit of the Americas in Miami. </P> <P> On Saturday Kantor replied to a question about Chile by saying ``a very important announcement'' would be made soon. ``Watch Miami very closely '' he said. </P> <P> ``It's time to be concrete and live up to promises '' he added. </P> <P> Clinton has promised Chile will be the next country to join NAFTA which consists of the United States Mexico and Canada. </P>,Canada,China; Mexico; Chile; Indonesia,0.00059777, , ,

APW_ENG_19941113.0182,2/11/2004, <P> Oksana Baiul fell twice. Nancy Kerrigan completed only one triple jump. Ice Wars didn't exactly bring out the best in the 1-2 finishers at the 1994 Winter Olympics -- or other figure skating stars. </P> <P> That doesn't mean there won't be a sequel. </P> <P> Many of the eight skaters who competed in the made-for-TV event said they liked the concept of international team competition and with a few adjustments would welcome an Ice Wars II. </P> <P> ``We all want to legitimize professional skating '' Kristi Yamaguchi said Saturday night after she and her teammates on the United States team won the competition 230.7 to 228.1 over the World team. </P> <P> ``This is so much more fun '' said Canada's Kurt Browning who struggled at the Olympics in 1992 and this year. ``It's a whole team versus a whole team ... All my life I've been doing a certain kind of competition.'' </P> <P> Fashioned after the Ryder Cup of golf and the Davis Cup of tennis Ice Wars was held over two days last week. Four of the top skaters from the United States were pitted against four who comprised a world team. </P> <P> Team USA which held a slight edge after the technical program in New York Wednesday also won the artistic competition Saturday at the Providence Civic Center. The winners split dlrs 400 000. </P> <P> Even though the skaters appeared relaxed and seemed to lack the intensity displayed in the Olympics or World Championships most of them said they took the two-day event seriously and felt it was a legitimate competition. </P> <P> But Baiul whose performance fell far short of the one that earned her the gold medal at Lillehammer Norway didn't agree. Baiul who recently underwent surgery on her left knee fell once each night. She was the only skater to fall throughout the entire competition. </P> <P> ``It's less a competition and more of an exhibition '' she said. ``I like either one. I like to be in front of the public.'' </P> <P> Browning acknowledged that the bottom line was entertaining the fans. </P> <P> ``I think that's why I was brought here '' he said. ``Coming in first instead of second that would be great but that's not my job. My job is entertaining the fans and I think I fulfilled that.'' </P> <P> Browning like some other skaters said international team competition was a good idea and that Ice Wars was a good way of embarking on the ``New Era'' of figure skating. </P> <P> ``I think it's going to evolve '' Browning said. </P> <P> Some of the skaters didn't like the lighting used during the artistic program while others had trouble adjusting to the time constraints of live television. </P> <P> Brian Boitano the 1988 Olympic champion who gave one of the better overall performances at Ice Wars didn't like the spotlights used Saturday. </P> <P> ``I felt a little better at the first competition because they didn't have the spotlights '' Boitano said. ``With the spotlight it didn't seem as serious as the first night ... It bothers me a little. We're competing out there.'' </P>,Canada,Norway,0.00349466, , ,

Bosnian radio reported gains by government troops east of Mostar and south of Konjic saying more than 100 Serb troops were killed. </P> <P> The Serbs also seemed to be in trouble in northeast Bosnia near Bijeljina. An AP photographer said the Muslim-led government army had encircled Bosnian Serbs on Mount Majevica and a television relay tower about 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of Tuzla they were protecting. The photographer said Serb volunteers 18 and over from regional towns had gone to try to break the Bosnian army ring around the tower important to the Serb communication network. </P> <P> The photographer who also visited the Bihac pocket in the extreme northwest said Bosnian Serbs had advanced to within 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) of the town of Bihac from the south and within 15 kilometers (10 miles) from the east. Government troops defending Bihac are thus sandwiched between Bosnian Serb troops and rebel Serbs in Croatia to the north and west. </P> <P> The Bosnian Embassy in Zagreb Croatia said rebel Serbs on the border to the Bihac pocket were supporting their Bosnian Serb brethren with heavy artillery fire and claimed at least 7 000 volunteers from the Yugoslav republic of Serbia had joined the Bihac pocket battle. </P> <P> But Gen. Rasim Delic the government army commander said his troops held onto some strategic positions even after relinquishing others.

That would escalate already rampant tensions in the region. </P> <P> Croatian officials have indicated they would consider attacking the rebel Serbs who captured a third of their republic in 1991.

Maj. Koos Sol a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo said they had grabbed about 40-50 square kilometers (16-20 miles) as they moved toward the strategic high ground. </P> <P> The U.N.

The meeting was jointly requested by Bosnia and Croatia. </P> <P> Reporting on fighting in the southwest near Mostar Bosnian Serb radio accused Bosnian government commando units of infiltrating into a Serb area near the town of Nevesinje and killing two women in one raid and an ambulance driver a paramedic and the wounded Serb soldier they were aiding in another. </P> <P> Bosnian Serb military officials said government fighters killed six civilians in northwestern Bosnia near the Una River first shooting them then finishing them off with ``knives axes and hammers.'' </P> <P> There was no Bosnian reaction or independent confirmation of the charge. </P> <P> Analysts estimate the Bosnian army has about 120 000 troops and can call on help from another 50 000 members of the Bosnian Croat militia. The Bosnian Serbs are believed to have about 80 000 troops but are better armed. </P> <P> Trying to exploit their manpower advantage the Bosnian army appears to be trying to stretch the Serbs thin by launching near simultaneous offensives on different front areas. </P> <P> Delic told Bosnian TV late Saturday that his troops have retaken about 3 percent of the more than 70 percent of Bosnia held by the Serbs. </P>,France,Serbia; Croatia,0.002778928, , ,

If convicted she could be sentenced up to two years in prison. </P> <P> She became a target of radical Muslims and the Bangladesh government after an Indian newspaper quoted her in May as saying she wants ``thorough revision of the Koran.'' </P> <P> Rushdie is author of the controversial ``Satanic Verses.'' The British writer and others connected with publication or distribution of the book have been under a death order since 1989 by Iran whose leaders say the book is blasphemous.

She went into hiding to evade arrest. Two months later she surrendered to the High Court and was set free on bail.

A big bloc of voters is still in doubt and could be swayed by the other Nordic countries being part of the EU. </P> <P> Exit polls in Sweden indicated that voters there had approved membership. Finland said ``yes'' last month and Denmark has belonged since 1972. </P> <P> ``Now I think Norway will say `yes' as well '' said Jan Petersen chairman of the pro-membership Conservative Party. ``It is a matter of Norway standing alone or being part of what happens.'' </P> <P> The Conservative Party one of the largest opposition parties in Norway's Parliament and the ruling Labor Party both support EU membership. </P> <P> But Kjell Magne Bondevik of the anti-membership Christian Democratic Party said Swedes shouldn't be allowed to decide what Norway will do. </P> <P> ``The ``no'' side now has to point out the advantages of remaining outside the EU '' he said. </P> <P> In a poll published Sunday 54 percent of those who had made up their minds said it would be best for Norway to join the union yet 56 percent planned to vote against membership anyway while just 44 percent said they would vote ``yes.'' </P> <P> ``This means that a sector of voters puts business interests or emotions ahead of the national interests of their country '' said the Verdens Gang newspaper which published the poll. </P> <P> Verdens Gang said it dropped undecided voters from its calculation of the two sides strengths even though 16 percent of those asked in the telephone poll of 815 people hadn't made up their minds. </P> <P> The Scan-Facts polling institute also asked doubters what they thought was best and 80 percent said membership was probably best even though they weren't sure how they would vote. </P> <P> Thorbjorn Jagland chairman of the ruling Labor Party said the poll might indicate that Norwegians are more positive to the Union that past surveys had indicated. </P> <P> ``I think we might be in for a surprise in the final sprint a positive surprise seen from my side '' said the pro-EU party leader about the poll. </P> <P> Kristen Nygaard leader of the ``No to EU'' organization said all the poll shows is that Norwegians don't want to rush into membership and would prefer to see how the Union develops. </P> <P> ``My advice is to vote `no' and then wait to see what happens '' he said. </P> <P> Norwegians narrowly rejected membership in a bitter 1972 national referendum which often haunts the ``yes'' side since today's supporters use many of the same arguments that failed to sway voters 22 years ago. </P>,Sweden,Norway; Finland; Denmark,0.200000003,0.029142704, ,

A large bloc of voters is still in doubt and could be swayed if other Nordic countries join. </P> <P> Before Sweden's approval Sunday Finland had said ``yes'' last month. Denmark has belonged to the community since 1972 when it was called the European Economic Community. </P> <P> ``Many people were concerned about what our neighboring country would do.

They accused the government of trying to stampede Norwegians into membership by making sure Sweden and Finland voted first. </P> <P> ``The Norwegian people to put is mildly have been skeptical '' said Erik Solheim head of the anti-EU Socialist Left Party. ``The only chance of getting Norway into the EU was putting the referendum 14 days after Sweden.'' </P> <P> Anne Enger Lahnstein chairwoman of the largest anti-membership party the Center said the pro-EU side ``wants to scare and threaten because they have no hope of the Norwegian people entering the union enthusiastically.'' </P> <P> She added ``I think we can manage a `No' but that requires a strong grassroots mobilization.'' </P> <P> Jan Petersen chairman of the pro-membership Conservative Party was just as hopeful the other way. </P> <P> ``Now I think Norway will say `yes' as well.

New Zealand was fourth at 23-under. </P> <P> ``They didn't hit it like they would have liked today which made things easier for us '' Couples said. ``It's a lot more comfortable playing with a double-digit lead.'' </P> <P> Couples and Love indicated they would be back to try for a fourth title next year in China although they haven't yet received an official invitation. </P> <P> ``Everyone from the (International Golf Association) keeps saying `We'll see you in China ' so I guess that means they want us back '' Love said. </P> <P> ``I think we'll go for No. 4 '' Couples said. ``I've enjoyed playing in this tournament and we've done well together.'' </P> <P> Constantino Rocca shot 68 Sunday to finish second at 270.

APW_ENG_19941113.0349,4/23/2005, <P> Nigel Mansell was all smiles and celebrations at his Australian Grand Prix triumph. </P> <P> But after clinching Sunday's victory though his next challenge is finding a contract for next season. </P> <P> ``We might go fishing we might go motor racing really it's in the hands of the powers that be '' he said. </P> <P> Mansell 41 currently is negotiating with Williams-Renault about partnering fellow Briton Damon Hill next season. Williams-Renault already has world championship runnerup Hill contracted and also could use promising David Coulthardt who raced for them after the death of Ayrton Senna in the San Marino Grand Prix. </P> <P> Mansell who raced four times for Williams this season said he expects a decision within two to three weeks. Several other teams also are reported to be interested in signing him. </P> <P> ``Everyone will just have to be a little bit more patient '' Mansell 1992 world Formula One champion and 1993 PPG IndyCar Series champion said. ``I think you'll find that it will all be sorted out in the next couple of weeks.'' </P> <P> Mansell's spent all of 1993 and most of 1994 driving in IndyCar races and </P> <P> was delighted to win in Adelaide where he had raced seven previous times without success. </P> <P> ``To win down here in Adelaide which is almost like a second home is extra special '' he said. ``I think it was great for the fans and I think it was pretty good for the sport too.'' </P> <P> Mansell's win came after the two world drivers' championship contenders Benetton-Ford's Michael Schumacher and Hill collided on lap 36 and crashed out of the race. </P> <P> The accident left 25-year-old Schumacher as the first German Formula One champion with 92 points to Hill's 91. </P> <P> With Schumacher and Hill out Mansell took control for the 31st Grand Prix win of his career and his first since he triumphed in Portugal in 1992. </P> <P> Gerhard Berger of Austria a two-time winner in Australia was second in a </P> <P> Ferrari while Martin Brundle of Britain was third in a McLaren-Peugeot. </P>,Austria,Australia; Portugal,0.001481529, , , 
APW_ENG_19941113.0359,5/6/2005, <P> It's three down and one to go in the European Union's 1994 sweepstakes. </P> <P> Swedes voted Sunday to join the union following Finland's lead last month and Austria's ``yes'' in June. Voters in Norway the most hesitant of the four countries will cast their ballots in two weeks. </P> <P> ``I think the decision will be very close but I believe in a Norwegian `yes' '' said Thorbjorn Jagland chairman of the ruling Labor Party in Oslo. </P> <P> Having a new bloc of Scandinavian countries would shift the European Union's balance more toward the prosperous North and further away from the often-struggling South. </P> <P> At the same time Poland and Hungary are eager to join as the last step in shaking off their communist past in Eastern Europe. </P> <P> ``We have a lot of problems to face together '' Hans van den Broek the union's foreign affairs chief said after Sunday's referendum trend was announced. ``They can't be solved purely on a national basis.'' </P> <P> One of the leading problems is high unemployment and in Sweden it runs about 12 percent. </P> <P> Van den Broek also brought up the sensitive issue of Sweden's neutrality which the country maintained during four decades of being squeezed between NATO countries and the Warsaw Pact. He told reporters in Brussels Belgium where the EU is headquartered that he was certain ``Sweden will play its part'' in maintaining peace and stability in Europe. </P> <P> If Norway on Nov. 28 joins Sweden Finland and Austria in saying ``yes '' the EU next year will grow to 16 members with a dlrs 7 trillion economy. It would encompass 375 million people from the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean Sea. </P> <P> Though trade and business still are the dominant bonds the EU increasingly is reaching out into other areas such as cultural programs. </P> <P> Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson called Sunday a ``happy day'' for his country and said he would work to bring down the jobless rate within the union. </P> <P> ``We also want to put an emphasis on environmental problems and on battling right-wing extremism and racism '' he added. Like Germany this country of 8.6 million people is seeking to control neo-Nazis. </P> <P> Sweden's parliament dominated by staunchly pro-EU forces is certain to give final approval to membership. Finnish lawmakers are expected to do likewise this week. </P> <P> The ``yes'' side drew 52.2 percent of the votes in Sunday's referendum compared with 46.9 percent opposed after a campaign that focused on virtually every aspect of daily life. </P> <P> Opponents claimed Sweden would be flooded with environmentally damaging substances under EU rules. They also argued that the union's goal of open borders would flood Sweden with illegal drugs. </P> <P> Children's book author Astrid Lindgren who doubles as the nation's conscience urged voters to say ``no'' as a means of protecting animals from EU regulations. </P> <P> Many women said their hard-fought rights under the country's heavily socialist system would be trimmed. </P> <P> Just how that socialist system will fit into the EU's dominant trend of encouraging free markets is unclear. </P> <P> Swedes pay dearly in taxes for their benefits including all-day care for children excellent medical coverage and iron-clad job security. </P> <P> Many young Swedish professionals fervently supported EU membership which will give them the right to work anywhere within the union's countries often paying less in income taxes than they would at home. </P> <P> That in turn has led to fears of a brain drain at the same time the country is battling an economic downturn. </P>,Austria,Sweden; Hungary; Belgium; Norway; Finland; Poland; Germany,0.007083192, , , 
APW_ENG_19941113.0363,1/16/2004, <P> Stretching from Norway to France Hitler's Atlantic Wall was a formidable chain of bunkers and artillery batteries. Many remain as haunting relics of an unfinished defense the Allies raced against time to overrun. </P> <P> Fifty years after World War II the concrete blockhouses with walls up to 10 feet (three meters) thick are virtually indestructible or too expensive to tear down. They've been turned into vacation homes restaurants cafes arsenals museums archives granaries a cancer clinic a yacht club even a discotheque. </P> <P> About 1.3 million prisoners and workers were detailed to build 15 000 fortified positions along the 2 400-mile (4 000-kilometer) coastline for radar artillery and 300 000 soldiers said Remy Desquesnes a historian at the Caen Memorial and Peace Museum. </P> <P> The project began in spring 1942 and was to be have been completed by May 1943. But by the D-Day invasion at Normandy on June 6 1944 only about 10 000 positions stood ready Desquesnes said. </P> <P> Rushing to finish the job the Germans cannibalized France's infamous Maginot Line which the Germans avoided at the start of the war by going through Belgium. The network of underground bunkers and tunnels on France's northeastern border was stripped of cannon compressors and other equipment. </P> <P> ``It was a race against time '' Desquesnes said. ``The more D-Day was delayed the stronger the Wall became.'' </P> <P> In Normandy alone the wall had 800 firing positions with 3 000 artillery pieces. </P> <P> Probably the best-known section of the Atlantic Wall is the complex at Pointe du Hoc on a steep Normandy coastal cliff. U.S. Army Rangers stormed it on D-Day but suffered heavy casualties. </P> <P> At Douvres-La-Delivrande near Caen is a former German radar station that is now a museum featuring a tracking room and cramped submarine-like living quarters. The last crew was driven out by Allied flamethrowers. </P> <P> Farther down the road toward the coast is a former artillery battery that guarded the entrance to the strategic Orne River whose Pegasus Bridge was the first seized by the Allies before dawn on D-Day. </P> <P> The battery with a coat of white and blue paint is now Le Surfer discotheque. Inside the small fort artillery shells have been replaced by glass columns filled with water and bubbles and a searing rave beat is as loud as gunfire. Sheet metal slickens the dance floor and black rubber matting keeps the barflies from slipping. </P> <P> Morbid? </P> <P> ``No. People think it's original '' co-owner Michel Carrasco said as patrons lined up at the door. </P> <P> The Dutch section of the Wall consisted mainly of defensive structures the Dutch had already built before the Nazi invasion in 1940. One bunker is used in The Hague by the government to store archives another as a wine cellar. </P> <P> The Atlantic Wall was built with assembly line efficiency using standardized blueprints doors ventilation and other equipment Desquesnes said. </P> <P> Some of the strongholds were equipped with enough water food medicine and workshops to survive a 30-day siege. </P> <P> The Wall also included about 500 000 obstacles such as tank traps and millions of land mines. </P> <P> Most of the builders were slave laborers from the Soviet Union but also Czechs Poles and Jews Desquesnes said. Workers included geologists botanists even artists. </P> <P> The Nazis pressed movie set designers into service to camouflage the sides of the bunkers with tromp l'oeuil windows to make the structures look like houses. </P> <P> The project was run by the Todt Organization named after the builder Fritz Todt who died in a plane crash in 1942. Todt had supervised construction of the Siegfried Line a defense bulwark on Germany's western border in addition to German autobahns underground weapons factories and civil defense shelters. </P> <P> In the end the Atlantic Wall failed. And it had sapped the Nazi war effort using an estimated 460 million cubic feet (13 million cubic meters) of concrete and 3 million tons of steel Desquesnes said. </P> <P> ``It wasted a lot of the Nazis' resources '' he said. ``The steel used in the blockhouses wasn't used in naval construction.'' </P>,Belgium,Norway; France; Germany,0.001510627, , , 
APW_ENG_19941113.0364,5/22/2004, <P> The bombs of World War II are still killing in Europe. </P> <P> They turn up -- and sometimes blow up -- at construction sites in fishing nets or on beaches 50 years after the guns fell silent. </P> <P> Hundreds of tons of explosives are recovered every year in France alone. Thirteen old bombs exploded in France last year killing 12 people and wounding 11 the Interior Ministry says. </P> <P> ``I've lost two of my colleagues '' said Yvon Bouvet who heads a government team in the Champagn-Ardennes region that defuses explosives from both World War I and II. ``One was pulverized. I saw the fire; I saw him ripped apart. They only found pieces of him.'' </P> <P> Officials estimate millions of pounds (kilograms) of bombs artillery shells land mines grenades torpedoes and other explosives are lying around in Europe or just off its coasts. </P> <P> In Germany an explosion thought to have been a World War II bomb killed three people in Berlin in September. On Oct. 17 about 10 000 people were evacuated from their homes in the southern Rhine River city of Ludwigshafen while experts defused a 3 600-pound (1 600-kilogram) bomb dropped by a British plane during the war. </P> <P> A Dutch team detonated a British bomb Oct. 8 after dredgers found it in a canal near Amsterdam. The same afternoon a few miles (kilometers) away Dutch experts defused an artillery shell found by a child playing. </P> <P> Unexploded bombs become more dangerous with time Bouvet said. </P> <P> ``With the corrosion inside the weapon becomes more unstable the detonator can be exposed '' he said. </P> <P> Despite 27 years of the high-stress work Bouvet 59 says he's still ``impassioned with the job '' although losing two colleagues did test his spirit. </P> <P> ``It took some time for me and my subordinates to get motivated again '' he said. ``We had pretty weak stomachs for about 10 days.'' </P>,France,Germany,0.008443936, , , 
APW_ENG_19941113.0365,5/25/2004, <P> The Plain Dealer citing a need to put 17 years of litigation into historical prospective has published an account of John Demjanjuk's fight against allegations that he was a Nazi death camp guard. </P> <P> ``It is finally clear that John Demjanjuk was neither `Ivan the Terrible' of Treblinka nor the hapless prisoner he claims to have been throughout World War II '' The Plain Dealer stated in the prologue of a 48-page report published on Sunday. </P> <P> ``We want to contribute to better understanding of the truth and the sensitivities inherent in the Demjanjuk case '' said Alex Machaskee the newspaper's president and publisher. ``Our goal with this special publication is to make sense out of the case for readers who read the story in bits and pieces over the years and enable them to judge the facts for themselves.'' </P> <P> Ed Nishnic Demjanjuk's son-in-law and the family's spokesman said on Sunday that he was disappointed in the newspaper's report. </P> <P> ``It is basically repeating the exact same story that has been told for the past three years '' he said. ``I seriously question the timing of it and believe it is full of speculation and hearsay that will inflame public opinion against Mr. Demjanjuk.'' </P> <P> David Hall editor of The Plain Dealer said in response that reporters wrote the section based on their coverage of the case. </P> <P> ``This piece of journalism read in its totality speaks very well for itself '' Hall said. ``It is comprehensive precise well-reported and thoroughly researched. </P> <P> ``I think the timing it irrelevant. It was put together not in a way to excite public opinion -- but rather to command analysis and attention '' he said. </P> <P> Demjanjuk a former autoworker lives in the Cleveland suburb of Seven Hills. </P> <P> He emigrated to the United States in 1952 and became a U.S. citizen in 1958. In 1977 the U.S. attorney's office in Cleveland filed suit to nullify Demjanjuk's citizenship alleging that he was ``Ivan the Terrible '' a sadistic guard at the Treblinka death camp in Poland during World War II. He denied the charge. </P> <P> Demjanjuk was stripped of his U.S. citizenship in 1981 imprisoned in 1985 and extradited to Israel in 1986 to stand trial for war crimes. </P> <P> He was convicted in 1988 and sentenced to death but the Israeli Supreme Court overturned the conviction in 1993. The court ruled that Demjanjuk was not ``Ivan the Terrible '' but justices said they still believed Demjanjuk worked for the Nazis in some capacity a charge he denied. </P> <P> Demjanjuk returned to his home in Seven Hills in September 1993. He has remained in seclusion while Justice Department lawyers fight for a court order that would expel him from the United States. </P> <P> Jewish protesters have demonstrated outside his home frequently since his return. </P>,Poland,Israel,0.600000024,-0.600000024,0.00024376, 
APW_ENG_19941113.0371,3/19/2004, <P> Cave dwellings and stepped paths cut into Amazon mountains indicate the Inca empire spread farther into the world's largest rainforest than was previously thought a government official says. </P> <P> Before Spanish soldiers conquered them in 1532 the Incas built a sophisticated society in the Andes stretching from present-day Ecuador south to Bolivia. </P> <P> The caves and paths were found on Pico da Neblina Brazil's highest point and the Bauri Mountains said Frederico Cruz Amazonas state secretary of the environment science and technology in Sunday's Jornal do Brazil newspaper. </P> <P> The mountains are in northern Brazil near Venezuela 800 kilometers (500 miles) to the northeast of areas traditionally thought to be the heart of the Incan empire. </P> <P> The caves and paths are similar to structures found at Machu-Picchu in Peru the Inca capital Cruz said. He said the caves had carvings of llamas animals native to the Peruvian Andes but not the Amazon. </P> <P> Experts believe the Incas went into the Amazon rainforest to collect and smelt gold. </P> <P> Incans used Amazon gold to adorn their cities and especially to make ritual instruments for their sun-worshipping religion said archeologist Adilson Rodrigues. </P>,Ecuador,Brazil; Peru,0.006388722, , , 
APW_ENG_19941113.0378,6/19/2006, <P> Wrapping up a career that has spanned 21 years and 167 tournament titles Martina Navratilova would like nothing better than to rekindle the old magic one more time. </P> <P> And there's no more fitting place to do it than the Virginia Slims Championships at Madison Square Garden. </P> <P> This season-ending dlrs 3.5 million tournament -- which begins Monday evening with eighth-seeded Kimiko Date of Japan taking on Germany's Sabine Hack -- has been dominated by Navratilova playing singles for the last time on the WTA Tour. </P> <P> Navratilova 38 has won seven singles and 11 doubles titles on the Garden carpet and four other times reached the singles final. </P> <P> Navratilova will be honored Tuesday evening following her first-round singles match against Gabriela Sabatini. In the post-match tribute to the 38-year-old great a banner bearing her name will be raised to the Garden ceiling where it will join the retired numbers for New York Knicks and New York Rangers players. </P> <P> ``It has been quite a ride for everybody '' Navratilova said. </P> <P> Monday night she will team with Manon Bollegraf of the Netherlands in a first-round doubles match. They will face Jill Hetherington of Canada and Shaun Stafford. </P> <P> Second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario favored to win her third major title of 1994 also plays Monday night taking on Julie Halard.

The singles winner collects dlrs 250 000 with dlrs 120 000 going to the runner-up. </P> <P> One thing will be certain this week: Navratilova will be the crowd favorite. It wasn't always so. </P> <P> ``If you go back 10-15 years ago it wasn't anything like that '' said Pam Shriver who teamed with Navratilova to dominate women's doubles for years. ``But they grew to know her and the barriers came down -- the barriers of someone with a funny name and a funny accent with a different lifestyle with muscles and going against Chris Evert. ... </P> <P> ``There were a lot of reasons why there wasn't a connection early on but there were all those reasons in the end for those barriers to come down.'' </P>,Canada,Netherlands; Japan; France; Bulgaria; Germany; Croatia,0.002569309, , ,

They said four men and two women were arrested. </P> <P> Indonesia annexed East Timor half of the island of Timor in 1976 after intervening in a civil war that followed Portugal's withdrawal from its former colony. Human rights groups have accused Indonesia of widespread abuses in East Timor since then. </P> <P> The United Nations never recognized the annexation although Australia and the United States have. </P> <P> Harold Mutcho the New South Wales spokesman for Fretilin the East Timorese liberation movement said the protests were designed to be a show of support for protests in Jakarta and Dili the capital of East Timor. </P> <P> East Timorese rampaged through Dili on Sunday clashing with police who fired tear gas.

APW_ENG_19941113.0387,6/14/2004, <P> Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said Monday his criticism of Thai military and business support for the Khmer Rouge had been ``a little unfair.'' </P> <P> Evans had accused elements of the Thai officers' corps of letting the Khmer Rouge into the country from neighboring Cambodia and said some Thai businessmen were buying lumber and gemstones from them. </P> <P> Thai officials denied the allegations and suggested Thailand might cancel lucrative military contracts with Australia if it didn't apologize. Australia had been counting on Thailand's support at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum this week for a call to end trade barriers in the region by 2020. </P> <P> Evans told Parliament on Monday that his weekend discussions with Thai Foreign Minister Thaksin Shinawatra were the most satisfactory in years. </P> <P> ``I was ready and willing to concede a point that perhaps I had been a little unfair in speaking as much as I did in the present tense given the changes that have occurred manifestly since July '' Evans said. </P> <P> In his original remarks Evans blamed the Khmer Rouge for the deaths of Australian backpacker David Wilson and his two traveling companions Briton Mark Slater and Frenchman Jean-Michel Braquet. </P> <P> Evans said the Khmer Rouge was still receiving support from elements of the Thai military and business communities and said that was ``unacceptable.'' </P> <P> Evans said his Thai counterpart offered to show Australian and other diplomats measures his government is taking to prevent contact with the Khmer Rouge in border areas. </P>,Cambodia,Thailand; Australia,0.003886202, , , 
APW_ENG_19941114.0003,10/12/2004, <P> President Clinton sought stronger trade ties with China on Sunday emphasizing security and economic issues over human rights in a meeting with China's president. </P> <P> Opening a fast-paced day of private talks with Asian leaders Clinton met with President Jiang Zemin. Human rights were not the main focus of the discussion because the Chinese are well aware of U.S. complaints officials said. </P> <P> The key issue was North Korea's agreement to freeze and ultimately dismantle facilities suspected of being capable of producing nuclear weapons. Jiang said he was very pleased with the accord and that there were no differences with Washington about that officials said. </P> <P> On another delicate arms issue the administration has offered to forgive China for exporting M-11 missile technology to Pakistan in violation of an international accord -- if China admits to its violations said an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity. </P> <P> Under the proposal the U.S. would waive possible sanctions which the administration estimated would cost American companies billions of dollars. China denies it has shipped missiles or missile parts to Pakistan. </P> <P> Clinton met with Jiang before joining leaders of 17 other nations at a summit on expanding trade with Asia's booming economies. In addition the president was holding one-on-one talks with the leaders of Japan South Korea and Australia. </P> <P> The president also squeezed in a tour of the Istiqlal Mosque reputed to be the largest in Southeast Asia. Out of respect he shed his shoes and walked in stocking feet on prayer mats through the mosque. Morning prayers were canceled for Clinton's visit. </P> <P> In talks with Jiang Clinton raised complaints about protection of U.S. intellectual property rights and Beijing's barriers to trade officials said. </P> <P> The Chinese leader pressed for preferential treatment as a developing country in world trading organizations but Clinton said China would have to follow the rules that apply to other nations officials said. </P> <P> The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum was clouded by protests intended to draw attention to Indonesia's human rights problems. </P> <P> Demonstrators staged a sit-in at the U.S. Embassy and rampaged through the East Timorese capital of Dili 1 500 miles from Jakarta on Sunday. They demanded independence for East Timor a former Portuguese colony invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed the following year. </P> <P> Clinton promised to discuss human rights concerns with Indonesian President Suharto. </P> <P> Organizers hope the APEC conference opening with a dinner Monday night will agree to free trade in the region by 2020 though China and Malaysia are resisting. </P> <P> Frictions with China eased somewhat after Clinton granted most-favored-nation trade status to China and Beijing has agreed to several business deals including a dlrs 1.6 billion purchase of American passenger aircraft. </P> <P> Before flying to Indonesia Clinton commemorated World War II victories in the Pacific and toured bomb-ravaged Corregidor Philippines the scene of fierce fighting and Allied humiliation a half-century ago. </P> <P> Warmly toasting Clinton at Malacanang Palace Sunday night Philippine President Fidel Ramos sounded regretful about Clinton's election setbacks. </P> <P> Praising the president's foreign policy and economic record Ramos said ``These achievements have apparently not had the recognition that they deserve in your country.'' </P> <P> Quoting scripture Ramos assured Clinton ``No prophet is accepted in his hometown.'' Secretary of State Warren Christopher traveling in Asia before Clinton arrived encountered near universal concern about the election impact officials said. </P> <P> First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was asked about the elections during a meeting with Philippine relief workers. ``I don't know yet exactly what the message from the voters was '' she replied. Her uncertainty contrasted with Clinton's statement last week that voters ``sent us a clear message -- I got it.'' </P> <P> Commenting on the election's impact on world affairs during a sweltering news conference with Ramos Clinton said ``I don't expect it to have any impact on our foreign policy.'' </P> <P> ``The foreign policies I have pursued particularly the mission I'm now on have enjoyed wide bipartisan support among centrists in both parties '' he said. </P> <P> Yet Clinton noted that some Democrats and Republicans are uncomfortable with his free-trade campaign which could complicate his efforts to win passage of a new world trade agreement when Congress meets late this month. </P> <P> In Washington Sunday incoming Senate majority leaders Bob Dole said he wants the Clinton administration to make it easier to pull out of the trade pact. </P> <P> Dole who had suggested he is predisposed to back the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade warned Sunday ``I haven't signed off yet'' on GATT. The current U.S. Congress is to take it up in special sessions later this month before the Republican-controlled Congress takes over in January. </P>,Pakistan,China; Japan; Philippines; Malaysia; Australia; Indonesia,0.001810968, , ,

It would encompass 375 million people from the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean Sea. </P> <P> The new EU would surpass the North American Free Trade Agreement which encompasses 363 million people in Mexico the United States and Canada and a combined gross domestic product of $6.3 trillion. </P> <P> In addition former communist states of Poland and Hungary are eager to join the union. </P> <P> ``We have a lot of problems to face together '' Hans van den Broek the union's foreign affairs chief said Sunday. ``They can't be solved purely on a national basis.'' </P> <P> One of them is unemployment. Sweden's jobless rate is about 12 percent and Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson promised Sunday to work to reduce it together with other union members. </P> <P> Some 52 percent of voters Sunday favored union membership and 47 percent were opposed. Many young Swedish professionals fervently supported EU membership which would allow them to work in any member country and probably pay less in income taxes than they do now. </P> <P> Still just how Sweden's socialist system will adjust to the EU's dominant free-market trend remains to be seen. </P> <P> Swedes pay dearly in taxes for their benefits which include all-day child care excellent medical coverage and iron-clad job security. Some women fear their hard-won rights will be challenged under EU rules that attempt to harmonize legal labor and other standards. </P> <P> Carlsson said he wants the union to emphasize environmental problems and battling right-wing extremism and racism. Like Germany this country of 8.6 million people is seeking to control neo-Nazis. </P> <P> Sweden's parliament is certain to accept the result of Sunday's non-binding referendum and give final approval to membership. </P>,Canada,Austria; Sweden; Hungary; Norway; Finland; Poland; Mexico; Germany,0.003426336, , , 
APW_ENG_19941114.0015,8/30/2004, <P> Opening meetings with Asian leaders President Clinton on Monday spelled out U.S. terms for increased economic ties with China and sought a consensus for keeping the heat on North Korea to honor its nuclear promises. </P> <P> In a face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin Clinton emphasized trade and security issues but also touched on human rights U.S. officials said. </P> <P> In advance of the formal opening of the 18-nation Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) Clinton also held separate meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating. A meeting also was scheduled with South Korean Prime Minister Kim Young-Sam. </P> <P> With Murayama Clinton discussed remaining areas of friction over trade pressing Japan to further open up its auto markets to U.S. imports officials said. </P> <P> Administration officials said China one of the last holdouts has now indicated a willingness to go along with an APEC communique advocating a goal of ``free and open trade'' throughout the Pacific by a specific date most likely 2020. </P> <P> Clinton also was pressing leaders to sign on to a statement that would increase the pressure on North Korea to make good on its commitment to dismantle its nuclear program. </P> <P> The president told reporters here he wanted to see ``continued progress on implementation.'' </P> <P> ``There's a lot of North Korea being discussed in every meeting '' said White House official George Stephanopoulos. ``He's going to talk to everybody about it.'' </P> <P> With little prospect of major agreement from the conference on other issues the administration seized upon North Korea as a topic on which it could get wide agreement. </P> <P> The president was still reeling from last week's midterm elections that handed control of Congress to Republicans for the first time in 40 years and administration officials saw the APEC session as an opportunity for Clinton to reassert himself as an influential figure on the world stage. </P> <P> At issue is North Korea's agreement to freeze and ultimately dismantle facilities suspected of being capable of producing nuclear weapons. Jiang said he was very pleased with the accord and that there were no differences between Washington and Beijing on the subject officials said. </P> <P> On another delicate arms issue the administration has offered to forgive China for exporting M-11 missile technology to Pakistan in violation of an international accord -- if China admits to its violations said an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity. Under the proposal the U.S. would waive possible sanctions which the administration estimated would cost American companies billions of dollars. </P> <P> However another official said this issue was not directly addressed in the meeting between Clinton and Jiang. </P> <P> ``The conversation was more general '' the official said. </P> <P> The president took time out from his series of meetings to tour the Istiqlal Mosque one of the largest in Asia. </P> <P> He shed his shoes and walked in stocking feet on prayer mats through the mosque. Morning prayers were canceled for Clinton's visit. Indonesia the world's fourth-most populous nation has more Muslims than any other country. </P> <P> Officials said that Jiang -- who first met with Clinton a year ago at an APEC session Clinton hosted in Seattle -- pressed for Chinese membership in world trade organizations like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. </P> <P> Clinton suggested that the United States would support the bid of China -- the world's third-largest economy -- to join such world bodies but insisted that it follow ground rules followed by other major industrial powers. </P> <P> These include intellectual property right protection and establishment of certain customs procedures and safeguards the officials said. </P> <P> The Chinese leader in turn pressed for preferential treatment as a developing country in world trading organizations -- which would exempt China from some of these rules that other big economic powers must follow. </P> <P> The APEC session was marred by protests intended to draw attention to Indonesia's human rights problems. </P> <P> Demonstrators staged a sit-in at the U.S. Embassy and rampaged through the East Timorese capital of Dili 1 500 miles from Jakarta. They demanded independence for East Timor a former Portuguese colony invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed the following year. </P> <P> Clinton promised to discuss human rights concerns with Indonesian President Suharto on Wednesday. </P>,Pakistan,China; Japan; Indonesia,0.001103015, , ,

APW_ENG_19941114.0057,5/8/2006, <P> Republican control of Congress means more opposition to U.S. peacekeeping missions more trouble for relations with the United Nations and more job security for Secretary of State Warren Christopher. </P> <P> That's the assessment of various congressional sources and foreign affairs experts as Republicans prepare to take over the foreign affairs committees -- thanks to majorities in both houses of Congress won last week -- and the legislature greets a new crop of conservatives suspicious of concerted international action. </P> <P> Dramatizing the change is the ascendancy of North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms to chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Helms nemesis of the State Department who consistently votes against foreign aid replaces Claiborne Pell an old-school Democratic internationalist and strong supporter of the United Nations. </P> <P> The Republicans' ``Contract With America '' their blueprint for the changes they want in government makes only one reference to foreign policy stating that no U.S. troops should be under U.N. command. </P> <P> But Republican antipathy to international peacekeeping spells trouble for President Clinton's promise to send some 25 000 U.S. peacekeeping troops to Bosnia if the warring factions there ever make peace. </P> <P> The congressional will is already being felt. The administration said Friday that the United States abiding by legislation passed last summer and promoted by soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole would pull out of NATO operations enforcing an embargo on arms to Bosnia's Muslims. </P> <P> Clinton has backed an end to the embargo but said it must not come in violation of U.N. resolutions or as a slap in the face to allies such as Britain and France that oppose allowing more arms into Bosnia. </P> <P> Beyond peacekeeping Helms and other conservatives regard the United Nations the World Bank and other international groups as bastions of Third World waste and corruption and are certain to oppose funding for these institutions. </P> <P> ``Frankly there will be a lot of questions about the U.N. sucking money out of our budget '' said one Republican staffer on the Foreign Relations Committee speaking on condition of anonymity. </P> <P> Abortion is likely to become more of an issue in U.S. support for international population programs and congressional support for environmental accords may wane. </P> <P> Even the new GATT free trade agreement to be taken up by the outgoing Congress later this month faces some opposition among normally pro-business Republicans because it includes creation of a new international body to monitor world trade. </P> <P> The Republican victory could complicate passage of four treaties pending before the Senate and its Foreign Relations Committee. </P> <P> Republicans have little enthusiasm for a biodiversity convention approved by the committee in June. </P> <P> Some business interests oppose a Law of the Sea treaty that would govern commercial development of the world's oceans. </P> <P> The Clinton administration is seeking ratification of a U.N. treaty banning discrimination against women that was approved in 1979 but ignored by the Reagan and Bush administrations. </P> <P> A treaty banning chemical weapons has been held up by conservative questions over the sincerity of Russian intentions. </P> <P> But the first fallout from the new Republican Congress could be what amounts to a hold on any planned changes in the Clinton foreign policy team said Philip Brenner an international politics professor at American University in Washington. </P> <P> Secretary of State Christopher long rumored to be on his way out may keep his job because the administration wants to avoid a confirmation battle with Helms famed for his ability to hold up and defeat nominations. </P> <P> In particular that goes for Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott a leading candidate to replace Christopher. Thirty-one Republicans opposed his nomination to his current position partly because of his writings critical of Israel when he was a reporter for Time magazine. </P> <P> The GOP's anti-communist instincts will also mean that ``the kind of nuanced effort to deal with leftist regimes will be much more difficult '' Brenner said. Republicans will be critical of any attempt to improve relations with Castro's Cuba or to reach accommodations on human rights in China or nuclear weapons in North Korea. Aid programs to Russia will face closer scrutiny he said. </P> <P> Dole speaking Sunday on CBS television said there are many areas where Republicans can take a united stand. ``We ought to get the troops out of Haiti by Thanksgiving. ... We ought to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia (and) we ought to investigate whether or not we got a good deal on North Korea.'' ------ </P> <P> EDITOR'S NOTE -- Jim Abrams covers foreign affairs on Capitol Hill for The Associated Press. </P>,Cuba,Haiti; China; Israel; France,0.000724534, , ,

All were attending the 18-nation Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) opening Monday evening. </P> <P> Clinton said the leaders all stressed the importance of ensuring that North Korea live up to the agreement with the United States to freeze and dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for energy aid and new political ties. </P> <P> ``They all said that they strongly supported the agreement. They thought it was very important that we continue to work it through. They understood implementation of the agreement would not be without difficulty '' Clinton said. </P> <P> Even on the opposite side of the world from America questions about last week's congressional elections dogged Clinton. </P> <P> Asked about his relations with the Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia expected to become House Speaker once Republicans take control of Congress in January; and Republican Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas in line to become Senate Majority Leader Clinton said: </P> <P> ``I look forward to working with them. My strategy will be to have an open door and to have a lot of contact.'' </P> <P> Clinton has been reassuring Asian leaders that despite the elections that handed Republicans control of both house of Congress for the first time in 40 years he still has a firm hand on U.S. foreign policy. </P> <P> In his session with Murayama Clinton discussed remaining areas of friction over trade pressing Japan to further open up its auto markets to U.S. imports officials said. </P> <P> Meanwhile support was coalescing around a U.S.-endorsed compromise -- expected to be formally endorsed on Tuesday by all 18 Pacific Rim nations at the conference -- calling for ``free and open'' trade throughout the region by no later than year 2020. </P> <P> Under the proposed communique developed nations like Japan and the United States would set an earlier goal of 2010; while less developed nations in the region would have the longer period according to U.S. officials. </P> <P> The dual timetable was an effort to meet objections to a firm timetable raised by China and Indonesia said U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. </P> <P> At his news conference Clinton said his goal was to make Asian markets ``as open to our products as ours are to theirs. I think Americans would like that.'' </P> <P> Asia is the fast growing economic region in the world. </P> <P> Even so Clinton cautioned Americans against expecting ``immediate results.'' </P> <P> Meanwhile he voiced sympathy for the students who had scaled the fence of the U.S. Embassy here and were conducting a sit-in on embassy grounds to protest Indonesian policy in East Timor which was annexed by Indonesia in 1976. </P> <P> ``We have no problem with these young people '' he said. </P> <P> Clinton promised to discuss human rights concerns with Indonesian President Suharto on Wednesday calling abuses in East Timor ``a concern to the United States.'' </P> <P> Clinton began the day with his meeting with the Chinese leader. </P> <P> In that session Jiang said conditions for improving U.S.-China relations were now ``rather beneficial and favorable '' and that China wanted to continue a dialogue with Washington on human rights a Chinese spokesman said. </P> <P> Foreign Ministry spokesman Chen Jian said Jiang told Clinton that ``China will not engage in an arms race '' including the spread of long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction and that China would not become a security threat to the United States. </P> <P> The Clinton administration has offered to forgive China for exporting M-11 missile technology to Pakistan in violation of an international accord -- if China admits to its violations said an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity.

There is no alternative but for all Egyptians to come together rich and poor to save their brothers in the disaster areas. </P> <P> In a split second they lost their homes and clothes and food and some of them lost their families. ... Hundreds of people have taken in their relatives struck by the flood disaster. But we repeat that this is like an exam in religion and nationality and humanity. Just slogans or words are not enough. Work has to be carried out. </P> <P> The government is doing what it can to contain the disaster but the people also have to do their best. Let the slogan for everyone be: help a disaster struck person you are a human and Egyptian. And those who do not do this are not real Egyptians. ------ </P> <P> Il Corriere della Sera Milan Italy on the rain and floods in Northern Italy: </P> <P> The catastrophe that shook some of Italy's most prosperous and industrialized regions is not the first and will not be the last. The reasons are historical... </P> <P> The first disturbing fact is the following: before and after Italy was united the regions of Piedmont Lombardy Venice and Tuscany were perfect models of how regions should be run. Politics in these states were strongly influenced by Vienna and Paris and they had a very refined knowledge of environmental control mechanisms for the soil and the rivers; policies that cannot even be compared to the hopeless ones of today. </P> <P> Traditionally it was the South `condemned by its geography' even before its economic backwardness to be the weak spot of the peninsula. But for the past thirty years we have witnessed a slow but implacable inversion of this tendency. </P> <P> This means that industrial development in this country was not only incapable of pursuing the policies of the past but that it placed geographically favorable regions in the same conditions in which the most desperate areas of the underdeveloped South were. </P> <P> Some will say that the present government bears no responsibility for this disaster.... </P> <P> It is true but it is also not true because in the last six months (Premier) Berlusconi not only did not do anything in this regard but on the contrary (with the latest amnesty on construction abuses) contributed to the ruin of this country. ------ </P> <P> Aftenposten Oslo on the fifth anniversary of the Berlin Wall: </P> <P> ``The fall of the Wall ... brought people's wishes and thoughts closer together in Eastern and Western Europe. Therefor we now see a more unified Europe growing before our eyes without walls and watchtowers and cocked guns and mines. It is in this new fellowship that Norway belongs.'' ------ </P> <P> Luzerner Neuste Nachrichten Lucerne on International Tribunal in The Hague: </P> <P> The first suspects to be brought to reckoning are just the smallfry however terrible their acts of cruelty may be. </P> <P> Those who actually pulled the strings of the war crimes the Karadzics the Milosevics and Mladics are still courted as trading partners . Whether they will ever be brought to reckoning for their crimes is more than doubtful. </P> <P> In The Hague it will not be the victors sitting in judgement over the defeated but the international community sitting in judgement over over war criminals. </P> <P> In recent months this community has often shown itself to be incapable of ensuring observance of human rights. Now it has its last chance.'' ------ </P> <P> Gulf News Dubai United Arab Emirates on Bosnia: </P> <P> ... Till now the Western powers have done nothing to stop the extremists Serbs whose land grab ethnic cleansing and war crimes add up to the worst aggression against a sovereign country and a people since the Second World War. </P> <P> The West should take the cue at least from Belgrade's pragmatic decision to cut all ties with the Bosnian Serbs for refusing to accept the peace plan. The U.S. and Europe must go beyond the peace plan to the best solution there is which is to keep Bosnia in one piece. If a federal system is proposed it should be on the basis of cantons without applying the divisive ethnic ``principle.'' Otherwise only the extremist Serbs would gain their objective which is to destroy Bosnia. ------ </P> <P> The Oregonian Portland Oregon on the CIA: </P> <P> Such were Aldrich Ames' problems with the bottle that the CIA operative who sold secrets to the Soviets would often return from liquid lunches and sleep at his desk. At least Ames had an excuse for his afternoon naps. </P> <P> The Senate Intelligence Committee's recently released report makes clear that lots of other folks at the Central Intelligence Agency were simply asleep at the switch -- no booze involved -- in their handling of the Ames spy scandal. </P> <P> In fact the committee's unanimous blast shows that the CIA top brass's sleepy reaction to the Ames scandal continues. Not a single CIA manager was fired demoted suspended or reassigned for failing to prevent or detect a case that caused more damage to U.S. national security than any in CIA history. Indeed only four current employees received letters or reprimand from CIA Director R. James Woolsey. </P> <P> This is not accountability. This is an invitation to the kind of mediocrity that allowed ``a virtual collapse'' of the agency's Soviet operations in the mid-1980s without a vigorous probe. </P> <P> We've learned to be skeptical when bipartisan unanimity breaks out on Capitol Hill. But the Senate Intelligence Committee's bipartisan outrage is justified.

He also pledged an ``open door'' in working with Republicans at home. </P> <P> After separate sessions with top Asian leaders Clinton promised to expand ties across the Pacific saying the United States is ``getting stronger in this region.'' U.S. officials predicted endorsement on Tuesday of a statement promoted by U.S. officialsm calling for ``open and free trade'' through the region by 2020. </P> <P> At a news conference in the garden of the U.S. ambassador's residence Clinton said he would ``use whatever influence I have in a positive way'' to press for human rights reform both in China and Indonesia. </P> <P> Clinton meanwhile voiced sympathy for the students who had scaled the fence of the embassy and were sitting on embassy grounds to protest Indonesian policy in East Timor annexed by Indonesia in 1976. </P> <P> ``We have no problem with these young people '' he said. He indicated he had received vows from Indonesia that they would not be punished. </P> <P> Clinton promised to discuss human rights concerns with Indonesian President Suharto on Wednesday calling abuses in East Timor ``a concern to the United States.'' </P> <P> He denied suggestions he was backing away from human rights concerns in pressing for more trade with Asia and said he raised the issue pointedly in a face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin a session that U.S. officials said emphasized trade and security issues. </P> <P> ``The United States perhaps more than any other country in the world consistently and regularly raises human rights issues '' Clinton said before the formal opening of the 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC). </P> <P> ``We made it absolutely clear that in order for the United States' relationship with China to fully flower there had to be progress on all fronts '' Clinton said. </P> <P> The Clinton administration has offered to forgive China for exporting M-11 missile technology to Pakistan if China admits to the violation said an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity. Imposing sanctions could have cost American companies billions of dollars. </P> <P> However another official said this issue was not directly addressed. The conversation between Clinton and Jiang ``was more general '' the official said. </P> <P> Later Secretary of State Warren Christopher told CNN that some sanctions remain in place on China dating back to the suppression of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square and ``they will not be taken off until we see some progress.'' </P> <P> Clinton spoke after separate meetings with Jiang Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating and South Korean President Kim Young-sam. </P> <P> The president said the leaders all stressed the importance of ensuring that North Korea live up to the agreement with the United States to freeze and dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for aid in energy supplies and new political ties. </P> <P> ``They all said that they strongly supported the agreement. They thought it was very important that we continue to work it through. They understood implementation of the agreement would not be without difficulty '' Clinton said. </P> <P> Clinton joined the leaders of Japan and South Korea for additional talks on North Korea after the dinner that opened the conference. </P> <P> Officials said the meeting was both a show of solidarity and an effort to thrash out details of how North Korea would be compensated for giving up its nuclear program. </P> <P> The plan calls for North Korea to be provided with other sources of energy less capable of producing plutonium for weapons. These are to be mostly supplied by the United States and cost about dlrs 4 billion mostly from South Korea and Japan. </P> <P> Clinton said the plan would ``require a lot of efforts on several fronts.'' </P> <P> Questions about last week's congressional elections dogged Clinton. </P> <P> Asked about his relations with the Rep. Newt Gingrich expected to become speaker of the House of Representatives in January and Republican Sen. Bob Dole in line to become Senate majority leader Clinton said: </P> <P> ``I look forward to working with them. My strategy will be to have an open door and to have a lot of contact.'' </P> <P> Clinton has reassured Asian leaders that despite the elections that gave Republicans control of both house of Congress for the first time in 40 years he still has a firm hand on U.S. foreign policy. </P> <P> In his session with Murayama Clinton discussed remaining areas of friction over trade pressing Japan to further open up its auto markets to U.S. imports. </P> <P> At his news conference Clinton said his goal was to make Asian markets ``as open to our products as ours are to theirs. I think Americans would like that.'' </P> <P> Asia is the fast growing economic region in the world. </P> <P> Even so Clinton cautioned Americans against expecting ``immediate results.'' </P> <P> Jiang said that conditions for improving U.S.-China relations were now ``rather beneficial and favorable '' and that China wanted to continue a dialogue with Washington on human rights Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Chen Jian said. </P> <P> Jiang told Clinton that ``China will not engage in an arms race'' nor threaten U.S. security Jian said. </P>,Pakistan,China; Japan; Indonesia,0.001044899, , ,

''Then there's the signing -- the invitations are in the mail.'' </P> <P> U.S. Assistant Secretary of State George Moose told reporters here the United States was ''deeply concerned'' by a continuing offensive by government troops and particularly by their capture last week of the rebel stronghold Huambo. </P> <P> Military sources said northern Uige the last of Angola's 18 provincial capitals still under rebel control was surrounded and government troops were attacking inside city limits. </P> <P> Skirmishes were reported around Huambo some 530 kilometers (330 miles) southeast of Luanda. </P> <P> Dos Santos and rebel chief Jonas Savimbi had been expected in Lusaka on Monday according to Zambian officials. </P> <P> But Samondo said Savimbi was still in Angola awaiting the outcome of the present talks. Dos Santos was in Luanda awaiting news from his delegation. </P> <P> Western diplomats say the government is risking possible U.S. sanctions by continuing the offensive especially with Republicans resurgent in Washington. </P> <P> North Carolina Sen.

APW_ENG_19941114.0305,5/5/2006, <P> Dozens of volunteers working long hours identified the remains of all 68 passengers and crew aboard the American Eagle commuter plane that crashed last month officials said Monday. </P> <P> The human remains from Flight 4184 were examined at a National Guard armory by technicians from the FBI Indiana State Police Armed Forces Institute of Pathology Cook County Ill. Medical Examiners Office and the Indiana Funeral Directors Association. </P> <P> David Dennis the Newton County coroner said Monday that the remains had been positively identified. </P> <P> The remains will be placed in caskets and returned by land and air to relatives. The first coffins were released Sunday and all should be shipped by late Monday the coroner's office said. </P> <P> The American Eagle ATR-72 propjet on a flight from Indianapolis to Chicago crashed Oct. 31 in a soybean field near Roselawn. </P> <P> Identification was difficult because of the severity of the crash. Authorities used dental records personal papers and other means to establish identities Steve Stitz deputy Newton County coroner. While all 68 victims were accounted for not all body parts were identified Stitz said. </P> <P> The work went more quickly than expected because of help from about 200 volunteers from the funeral directors association and from dentists around the country who faxed in records to a team of six dental investigators. </P> <P> The teams have been working 12 to 14 hours a day since the crash two weeks ago. </P> <P> A biohazard company has been hired to decontaminate the soybean field where the commuter plane crashed nose-first during a storm. The dirt absorbed fuel from the crash and may also be contaminated by blood-borne organisms. </P> <P> At least 17 of the victims were from foreign countries including six Britons three each from Colombia and Canada a Swedish couple and one person each from Germany Lesotho and South Korea. </P>,Colombia,Canada; Lesotho; Germany,0.001742064, , , 
APW_ENG_19941114.0311,6/12/2006, <P> Greece said Monday that it would ratify an international treaty on territorial waters but that this did not mean it would expand its limits from six miles to 12 miles. </P> <P> Neighboring NATO-ally Turkey has warned of war if Greece expands its waters in the Aegean Sea as this will result in Greece controlling all shipping channels in the sea between the two countries. </P> <P> The international treaty comes into effect on Thursday and both countries have warships on manoeuvres in the Aegean raising fears of a further increase in tension. </P> <P> Turkish Foreign Minister Mumtaz Soysal on Monday apparently tried to relieve the tension shortly before encountering his Greek counterpart Carolos Papoulias on the sidelines of a meeting of European defense and foreign ministers in the Dutch city of Noordwijk. </P> <P> Athens' Antenna radio network quoted Soysal as saying that nothing will happen Thursday as ``we will not give the pleasure of seeing two neighbors fight each other.'' </P> <P> Greece has repeatedly said that it will not give up the right to expand its waters but that it has no immediate plans to do so. It does however plan to ratify the treaty at a future date. </P> <P> ``On the issue of ratifying the treaty Greece will act in harmony with the European Union and its members keeping the rhythms of the European Union and its members '' government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos told reporters. </P> <P> ``This treaty does not force countries to have certain territorial waters. It sets out the limit within which territorial waters can be expanded '' he said. </P> <P> Many countries of the European Union of which Greece is a member have ratified the treaty as has the United States. </P> <P> A U.S. Navy ship the USS Cape St. George was ordered into the Aegean in hopes that its presence will help abate tensions in the region the Pentagon said Friday. </P> <P> Greek warships are on manoeuvres in the southern Aegean and the Sea of Crete along with ships from France Spain Britain Italy and the United States in an exercise called Niriis 94. </P> <P> Turkish ships are taking part in an exercise called Sea Wolf in the northern Aegean. </P> <P> The Greek Defense Ministry said last week that the Niriis exercise had been planned for Nov. 10 to Nov. 20 in the Aegean since June 1993. The Turkish exercise had originally been scheduled for Nov. 21 to Nov. 30 without Turkey saying where it would be held the ministry said. </P> <P> It said that the Turkish exercise was rescheduled in October in order to coincide with the one in which the Greek ships would be participating. </P>,Greece,Turkey; Italy; France; Spain,1.600000024,0.562125981, ,

APW_ENG_19941114.0327,3/26/2006, <P> President Clinton and other senior U.S. officials are discovering that last week's U.S. elections are a prime topic of conversation here. </P> <P> It's a problem with which most heads of states from democratic societies can identify. </P> <P> When Clinton conferred Monday with Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama the two leaders found that the tables had been turned since they met last summer in June at the summit of industrialized nations in Naples Italy. </P> <P> ``The president joked that at Naples the prime minister who had come just after the coalition in Japan had been formed'' had sought to reassure Clinton about continuity in Japanese foreign policy said a senior administration official. </P> <P> ``The president said that he was now in the position of reassuring the prime minister of our continuity in American foreign policy '' said the official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity. </P> <P> Mike McCurry a spokesman for Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters that Christopher had been asked by nearly every Asian leader he had met in talks over the past few days what the election results mean. </P> <P> One exception was China whose leaders have little experience with elections. </P> <P> President Clinton has already travelled overseas more than George Bush did in his first two years. Now Clinton he may outdo Bush again in travel on a single day. </P> <P> White House aides said that Clinton will likely visit Budapest Hungary in early December -- as a day trip. </P> <P> Bush whom Clinton criticized during his campaign for spending too much time on foreign policy travelled to Colombia in South America and back in a single day for a drug summit. </P> <P> But Bush never tried to get to Europe and back in a single day. </P> <P> The plan not yet final is for Clinton to leave after an evening gala at the Kennedy Center Dec. 4 for a meeting the next day in Budapest of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. </P> <P> He would spend three hours in Hungary squeezing in a meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin before flying home in time to host a Christmas party at the White House that evening. </P> <P> Clinton also may make a one-day trip to Haiti later in December. </P>,Colombia,Haiti; Hungary; Japan; China; Italy,0.200000003,-0.200000003,0.000435539, 
APW_ENG_19941114.0328,8/26/2006, <P> The Clinton administration plans no acceleration in the troop withdrawal from Haiti despite the wishes of Republican leaders Defense Secretary William Perry said Monday. </P> <P> ``They will not all be out by Thanksgiving (Nov. 24) by a long shot '' Perry said during a Pentagon photo opportunity. </P> <P> ``Our plan as we've announced before is to reduce to about 9 000 troops in Haiti by the end of the month '' Perry said. ``There will be further reductions in December.'' </P> <P> Perry's comments came a day after Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole said he would urge President Clinton to withdraw the entire U.S. force in Haiti in less than two weeks. </P> <P> Speaking on television Dole said the U.S. mission in Haiti to restore ousted President Jean Bertrand Aristide has been accomplished. </P> <P> ``It doesn't serve any purpose if there's no problem there '' Dole said. ``We ought to get the troops out of Haiti by Thanksgiving. ... Let's get out before there is any bloodshed.'' </P> <P> Dole's comments reflect the skeptical mood among the incoming Republican majority in Congress toward U.S. peacekeeping and democracy-building missions in other countries. </P> <P> ``I think the president should know now that Republicans who control the Congress may have a much different view on areas like Haiti and Bosnia and North Korea '' Dole said. </P> <P> The U.S. force in Haiti stood at 12 403 Monday down from a high of 15 000 in the weeks following the Sept. 18 deployment. About 2 500 U.S. troops have left Haiti since Nov. 7 the day before last week's election when the Pentagon announced it would cut its force of 15 000 by 6 000 by the end of November. </P> <P> Perry announced at the time that the Pentagon would continue to assess progress in Haiti. </P> <P> ``As missions are accomplished and objectives are met additional redeployments will be scheduled '' he said last week. </P> <P> Perry spoke Monday while having his picture taken with Defense Minister Abdelaziz Ben Dhia of Tunisia. </P>,Haiti,Tunisia,0.300000012,0.11921405, , 
APW_ENG_19941114.0336,1/1/2005, <P> PLO chief Yasser Arafat made good on pledges Monday to rein in Muslim militants as his security forces blocked hundreds of activists from participating in a street protest and hunted the leader of the most violent faction opposed to peace with Israel. </P> <P> Palestinian police set up roadblocks searched cars and turned away followers of the Islamic Jihad group trying to reach a mock funeral for a suicide bomber who killed three Israeli army officers last week. </P> <P> More than 500 activists managed to bypass police and rallied outside the home of the bomber calling for Arafat to lighten up on Islamic militants and threatening attacks against Israeli targets. </P> <P> An Islamic Jihad supporter from the Gaza town of Khan Yunis said he had to switch cars five times to make it to Hamad's home. </P> <P> ``Arafat we are not afraid of your arrests '' demonstrators shouted outside the house of Hisham Hamad who rode a bicycle into an Israeli army checkpost Friday and set off explosives strapped to his body. </P> <P> ``We are ready to kill and be killed '' they shouted. </P> <P> Several hundred men listened to fierce rhetoric over a loudspeaker handed out leaflets and one man burned an Israeli flag to the enthusiastic cheers of the others. </P> <P> ``We have many martyrs ' said one orator. ``Rabin this is the first act. Be ready for the next explosion. Be prepared for body bags.'' </P> <P> But with police barriers preventing most of their followers from arriving the Islamic Jihad postponed a symbolic funeral procession planned from Hamad's home. Palestinian police interred Hamad's body Friday without informing the family. </P> <P> Monday marked the first time police enforced a new ban on street protests as part of a widening crackdown on Muslim militants that also included the arrests of some 180 activists since the weekend. </P> <P> But Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Monday that Arafat had not done enough. ``No I am not satisfied '' Rabin told Israel TV. ``I will judge to what extent they meet our expectations...by their ability to prevent attacks from Gaza.'' </P> <P> Israeli leaders have charged that previous arrest raids ordered by Arafat were largely cosmetic and designed to appease Israel with detainees released after a few days. </P> <P> Arafat in the past has been reluctant to go after Muslim militants fearing he would set off street violence that could topple his government. Arafat also feared he would undercut his support among Palestinians if he looked like Israel's lackey. </P> <P> But several events have since pushed Arafat toward a showdown. </P> <P> On Friday after the bombing attack Israel made it clear that it would not consider expanding self-rule in the West Bank until Arafat proves he can control Gaza. </P> <P> The same day Islamic Jihad militants thumbed their noses at Arafat when during a Gaza City rally of 3 000 activists fired their guns in the air and men covered in white sheets showed their readiness to carry out suicide attacks. </P> <P> Arafat is also still bitter over having been thrown out of the mosque funeral for an Islamic Jihad leader earlier this month. </P> <P> Palestinian Justice Freih Abu Medein said Monday that Islamic Jihad has gone too far. </P> <P> ``We cannot allow two authorities to exist in Gaza '' he told The Associated Press. ``Otherwise we will lose our credibility.'' </P> <P> He said police planned to arrest the group's leaders and supporters including those involved in nonviolent activity such as writing wall graffiti and distributing leaflets. </P> <P> The first test of Arafat's determination was Monday with the mock funeral planned by the Islamic Jihad. </P> <P> The Muslim fundamentalist group meanwhile said it would not unleash a civil war despite the blow dealt by Arafat's troops. </P> <P> ``I think this is a shame for Arafat to commit (but) we will not do anything military against the authorities or against the policemen '' Fathi Shakaki a Damascus-based Islamic Jihad leader told Israel television Monday. </P> <P> But followers in Gaza threatened to assassinate the PLO leader. </P> <P> ``Arafat remember we killed Anwar Sadat '' they called referring to the late President of Egypt who was killed after signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1979. </P> <P> The group's Gaza leaders including chief ideologue Sheik Abdallah Shami were still on the run from police Monday. </P> <P> There had been conflicting reports throughout the day about Shami's whereabouts but a senior Arafat aide later said Shami had managed to escape the dragnet. </P>,Egypt,Israel,0.000243308, , ,

APW_ENG_19941114.0353,1/1/2006, <P> The incoming president of NATO's parliament proposed a strategic treaty with Russia and full membership for all European countries that wish to join the military alliance. </P> <P> The treaty would recognize Russia's role as a nuclear power and permit NATO to negotiate cuts in weapons arsenals and to work out restrictions on the spread of nuclear technology with Moscow. </P> <P> ``Russia is special and we should respect that '' the new NATO leader Karsten Voigt said Monday. Voigt who also is foreign policy spokesman for Germany's Social Democrats predicted the North Atlantic Assembly meeting here this week would approve expansion of the alliance. </P> <P> He said expanding NATO would involve guaranteeing all incoming nations -- former Communist states as well as neutrals -- that the alliance would come to their defense if attacked. </P> <P> Voigt said however that new members first would have to show that their military forces were under civilian control. </P> <P> ``We should say clearly we are ready for enlargement now '' Voigt said in a session with European and American reporters. </P> <P> Russia has registered concern that admission of its former allies could align most of Europe against Moscow. But Voigt said NATO's expansion would provide more stability for Russia as well as the rest of Europe. </P> <P> To allay Russian concerns he suggested NATO forces not be deployed heavily in eastern Europe and that NATO negotiate a strategic treaty with Russia. </P> <P> Together the alliance -- which includes the United States -- and Russia would set levels for nuclear stockpiles in Europe for curbing the spread of nuclear technology and adopt strategies for reacting to crises. </P> <P> ``Europe has to be protected against itself and its bad history '' Voigt said. </P> <P> The assembly's defense committee will take up the proposal to expand NATO on Wednesday. It will be taken up by the full assembly on Friday. Both meetings will be held here. </P> <P> Voigt said the expansion of NATO could be concluded within two to five years and that ``no nation should have a veto'' over the growth of the alliance formed originally to deter Soviet expansion. </P> <P> A decision by the assembly to expand NATO would not be binding on the alliance whose foreign and defense ministers are due to meet in Brussels Belgium next month. </P>,Belgium,Germany,0.100000001,-0.100000001,0.000812687,

They could have made peace with Israel the same time that President Sadat did and they would get exactly what the Egyptians got at the time and the whole story would be different. </P> <P> U.S. AID: Foreign aid is made up of two parts. One is dlrs 1.2 billion for economic aid and the other is dlrs 1.8 for military. In fact the dlrs 1.2 billion is being used for the service of the debt we owe to the United States. We owe it not because we bought luxuries in the United States this was the initial cost of peace with Egypt. </P> <P> PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY: I wish that the Palestinian Authority would be quicker and better in building its own institutions so as to answer the call for ... accountability which holds back the monies. The idea of having a donor conference came from me and the attempt to mobilize the necessary funds. There are more than dlrs 2.2 billion dollars. ... Hamas is one of the obstacles concerning the Palestinian Authority. There is a great deal of irritation about the terror of Hamas and the way that Hamas is being handled in the Gaza Strip.

APW_ENG_19941114.0365,3/25/2005, <P> Bosnian Serbs rolling back government army gains moved closer to the Croatian border on Monday provoking a warning from Croatia that it might send troops into Bosnia. </P> <P> Any offensive by Croatia against Bosnian Serbs could spin fighting in Croatia and Bosnia out of control and possibly tempt Yugoslavia to enter the war. </P> <P> Serbia which dominates what is left of Yugoslavia has stopped providing fuel and other supplies to the Bosnian Serbs as it seeks to end crippling U.N. sanctions for fomenting the war in Bosnia. But Bosnian Serbs have suggested that ties with Serbia are on the mend because of the U.S. decision to stop enforcing the arms embargo against the Muslim-led Bosnian government. </P> <P> Russia a traditional Serb ally is highly critical of the U.S. move. Russian special envoy Alexander Zotov met in Belgrade on Monday evening with Serbia President Slobodan Milosevic. </P> <P> Over the past few days Bosnian Serbs have retaken 80 percent of the land in the Bihac pocket in northwest Bosnia that they had lost to the Muslim-led government army in recent weeks U.N. officials said. </P> <P> A U.N. spokesman Maj. Herve Gourmelon reported firefights Monday two miles east of the Bihac city center just six miles east of the Croatian border. </P> <P> Bosnian radio said four rockets fired from Bosnian Serb territory hit the Cazin region north of Bihac causing an undetermined number of casualties and heavy damage. The United Nations said several ground-to-air missiles were fired by Bosnian Serbs at Cazin and Bihac. </P> <P> Government troops defending Bihac are sandwiched between Bosnian Serb soldiers and rebel Serbs in Croatia to the north and west who have provided artillery cover to the Bosnian Serbs. </P> <P> Gourmelon said this could be the ``definitive assault'' by Bosnian Serbs on the Grabez plateau strategic high ground just south of Bihac. But a senior Bosnian army officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said the Serb forces were not likely to recapture the plateau. </P> <P> Croatian Serbs captured one-third of Croatia in 1991 and their involvement in the Bihac fighting could give the Croatian government an opportunity to attack the rebels and regain the land. </P> <P> The clearest warning of possible Croatian military involvement came from Darko Bekic a Croatian diplomat. </P> <P> ``If Bihac falls ... we will be forced to assist neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina '' Croatia's HINA news agency quoted Bekic as saying. </P> <P> He said such intervention was stipulated by a U.S.-brokered deal joining Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats in a federation in March. </P> <P> ``We hope therefore that the international community will act and that direct assistance of the Croatian army to the Bosnian government will not be necessary '' he was quoted as saying. </P> <P> The U.N. Security Council on Sunday demanded that Croatian Serbs stop cross-border attacks. </P> <P> U.N. officials said fighting between Bosnian Serb and government forces in the Bihac region has left Bangladeshi U.N. peacekeepers with insufficient food medicine and weapons. Maj. Mohammed Bashir a spokesman for the Bangladeshis said they could run out of food by Nov. 25 and out of fuel by Dec. 1. </P> <P> In a sign of growing U.N. impatience U.N. spokesman Lt. Col Tim Spicer warned Bosnian Serbs against crossing the Una River that forms the border of the Bihac pocket. A Serb invasion would be a violation of the so-called ``safe area'' the United Nations has declared around Bihac. </P> <P> NATO air strikes could be ordered to protect safe areas. </P> <P> In fighting in the southwest the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA quoted military sources as saying a government offensive in the Nevesinje region southeast of Mostar had been stopped. </P> <P> But Gen. Ramiz Drekovic the regional commander of government troops said his soldiers had ``completely broken down'' the Serb counteroffensive capturing high ground near Mostar and moving within three miles of Nevesinje. </P> <P> Gourmelon the U.N. spokesman said there were two attacks on U.N. peacekeepers over the past 24 hours one during a firefight in Sarajevo and the other in northeastern Bosnia where a U.N. observation post southeast of Kladanj came under fire. </P> <P> Gourmelon said an investigation showed that shells fired at the Holiday Inn in Sarajevo came from Bosnian Serb positions. </P>,Serbia,Croatia,0.100000001,0.072815411, ,

APW_ENG_19941114.0392,12/4/2004, <P> CHICAGO (AP) - Wheat and soybeans futures prices finished strongly higher Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid increasing prospects for export sales. Corn drifted lower. </P> <P> Wheat futures prices were buoyed by news that Egypt turned down an offer to buy French wheat leading to ideas that purchases under the U.S. export credit program are imminent. Traders said they expected an announcement this week that Egypt is seeking 1.3 million tons of U.S. wheat sometime this week. </P> <P> Prices also rose on rumors that the Agriculture Department soon will offer Ukraine a credit package that will enable it to buy U.S. grain and soybeans. </P> <P> ``The export potential is there '' said Mickey Luth senior grains analyst with Merrill Lynch and Co. in Chicago. ``We just need to see some increased tender activity.'' </P> <P> Soybeans futures prices also gained on strength in the soybean oil market. Palm oil is under strong world demand in recent days and that has buoyed other vegetable oil futures prices. </P> <P> Corn futures prices faced continued pressure from the near completion of harvesting in the Midwest. Trading was light as investors considered that a record crop of 10.01 billion bushels is likely to drive prices lower. </P> <P> Wheat for December delivery rose 3 3-4 cents to dlrs 3.80 3-4 a bushel; December corn fell 1-2 cent to dlrs 2.17 a bushel; December oats fell 3-4 cent to dlrs 1.25 1-2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 4 cents to dlrs 5.55 3-4 a bushel. </P>,Egypt,Ukraine,0.008157473, , ,

APW_ENG_19941114.0422,12/31/2004, <P> The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an effort to reinstate a ban on importing yellowfin tuna from some countries. </P> <P> The justices without comment turned down an environmental group's argument that a federal judge in California had the authority to order the ban. A federal appeals court said he didn't. </P> <P> The Earth Island Institute a San Francisco-based environmental group sued the federal government in 1988 over a law aimed at reducing the number of dolphins that die after being caught in yellowfin tuna fishing nets. The lawsuit alleged a lack of enforcement. </P> <P> The law allows tuna to be imported only from countries whose fishing fleets meet U.S. standards. It also bars tuna routed from non-complying countries through nations that do comply. </P> <P> Michael Charlson a lawyer for Earth Island Institute said Monday there are several nations identified as ``intermediary'' importers of dolphin-unsafe tuna. He said the two main targets were Italy and Spain. </P> <P> He said they do not catch the tuna but buy it from other nations such as Mexico and in turn ship it to the United States. </P> <P> Earth Island Institute contended that the government was not enforcing the provision barring indirect imports of tuna from non-complying countries. A federal judge in San Francisco in January 1992 ordered the government to enforce that provision. </P> <P> But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling last July saying the judge lacked authority. The case must be handled by the U.S. Court of International Trade because it involves a dispute over an embargo the appeals court ruled. </P> <P> In the appeal rejected Monday the environmental group's lawyers said the law isn't related to international trade. They said federal law doesn't give the international trade court exclusive authority to decide disputes over embargoes involving public health and safety. </P> <P> Justice Department lawyers opposed the appeal. </P>,Italy,Mexico; Spain,0.002862995, , ,

APW_ENG_19941114.0499,5/2/2004, <P> In moves reminiscent of U.S. westward expansion during the 1800s American retailers are moving beyond the country's borders and staking claims in other nations particularly Mexico. </P> <P> In the past month retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Dillard Department Stores Inc. and Saks Fifth Avenue announced ventures in Mexico. </P> <P> Smaller companies are also looking southward. The off-price clothing chain 50-OFF Stores Inc. said this month it signed a letter of intent with a Mexican company to develop stores there. </P> <P> The idea of international expansion is not new -- companies including Toys R Us and Kmart began operating abroad years ago. Woolworth has been selling in Germany for more than half a century and has hundreds of specialty stores in Europe Australia Canada and Mexico. </P> <P> But setting up shop abroad has become more attractive with the development of new markets -- the westernization of former communist countries in Europe and the opening of Mexico through the North American Free Trade Agreement which Congress approved in 1993. </P> <P> The global expansion picked up a lot of momentum during the past year notes Larry Katzen former managing partner of Arthur Andersen and Co.'s Worldwide Retail Industry Practice and now managing partner of the accounting firm's St. Louis office. </P> <P> ``I believe more strongly in it now than I did'' a year ago he said. ``Looking at the turn of the century you're going to see U.S retailers in all parts of the world.'' </P> <P> ``I think the biggest areas will be in Asia the Pacific and in Latin America. Mexico is just a springboard into South America.'' </P> <P> These countries are attractive because their economies are growing and their consumers are expected to have more money to spend in coming years. There will be demand for more stores. </P> <P> The United States by contrast is considered a ``mature'' market where there is an overabundance of stores and malls and where growth for many retailers isn't a sure thing. </P> <P> With the middle class growing in developing countries ``there's a real passion for U.S. merchandise '' Katzen said. </P> <P> But a retailer can't just plop one of its U.S. stores in another country and start selling as if were Sheboygan Wis. or Des Moines. </P> <P> It is true that a company like Saks which caters to the very upscale shopper can transport its name and business to another country where worldly and wealthy consumers are likely to be familiar with the store. And Warner Brothers' cartoon characters have universal appeal giving the company's stores selling toys and clothes based on its characters an easy entree into countries like Britain. </P> <P> But Dillard Wal-Mart and Home Depot while they do have a certain cachet just by being American aren't household names outside the United States. </P> <P> And any retailer needs help before entering unfamiliar territory. Several have taken on local partners who have knowledge of real estate work force issues legal requirements and how to appeal to local customers. </P> <P> ``One must be very sensitive one must think locally adapt your business to the culture where you're operating '' said Lonnie Fogel a spokesman for Home Depot Inc. </P> <P> Companies also have to be careful about the kinds of stores they open and where they put them. Often this means painstaking research. </P> <P> ``It requires a significantly different operating style than in the U.S. '' Katzen said. </P> <P> He called J.C. Penney Co. Inc. a model of how retailers should operate in other countries. </P> <P> Penney sells private label men's clothes in Aoyama stores in Japan and also sells menswear in stores in Dubai and Singapore. It also has licensed catalog stores in the Caribbean Russia and Iceland. But it hasn't opened any of its full-line stores familiar to U.S. shoppers in these countries. </P> <P> ``They've tailored their operations to the needs of the local marketplace '' Katzen said. </P> <P> Seven big Penney stores will be opening in shopping malls in Mexico starting in March and one is also planned for Chile spokesman Duncan Muir said. </P> <P> Penney knew it would find eager customers in Mexico. ``We already do dlrs 100 million with Mexican shoppers through 22 stores along the border '' Muir said. </P> <P> Like other retailers Home Depot has moved very carefully and deliberately trying to see if its kind of retailing will work in other countries. </P> <P> Home Depot entered Canada through a joint venture with Molson Cos. which had started a chain of do-it-yourself home improvement centers called Aikenhead. ``It seemed to our mutual best interest'' to take on a partner Fogel said. The venture called Home Depot Canada has 12 stores. </P> <P> Home Depot is still exploring its options in Mexico having found the culture there may not be able to support the traditional Home Depot format. </P> <P> ``There's not a very large home-owning middle class so one has to be much more careful in picking your spots '' Fogel said. Homeowners in Mexico tend to be wealthy ``and they don't need to do things themselves ... They hire laborers or contractors.'' </P> <P> ``Mexico right now represents a rather small market in terms of overall sales of home improvement products '' he said. </P>,Canada,Singapore; Japan; Mexico; Australia; Chile; Germany; Iceland,0.000925762, , , 
APW_ENG_19941114.0502,10/27/2005, <P> Martina Navratilova awoke Monday not knowing whether there were two matches left in her career or two more chances to pad records that may never be broken by man or woman. </P> <P> No tennis player ever came close to Navratilova's combination of championships in singles -- a record 167 -- and doubles -- another record 165. And that's not even counting her 55 mixed doubles titles. </P> <P> At the Virginia Slims Championships on Monday night Navratilova teamed with Manon Bollegraf of the Netherlands in a doubles match against Jill Hetherington of Canada and Shaun Stafford. </P> <P> ``I just hope I can still pick up the racket and hit the ball over the net through all the emotion that I am sure I will be feeling '' Navratilova said. </P> <P> It will be even more emotional Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden when Navratilova goes after her last singles crown with a tough opening-round match against Gabriela Sabatini. </P> <P> The dlrs 3.5 million tournament started with eighth-seeded Kimiko Date of Japan beating Germany's Sabine Hack 6-3 6-0. Hack replaced Magdalena Maleeva in the elite 16-player draw. Maleeva pulled out with a rib injury. </P> <P> No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario the reigning French Open and U.S. Open champion played the second match against Julie Halard of France. Sanchez Vicario entered into the Slims Championships with a four-tournament 21-match winning streak including a three-set victory over Navratilova in the finals at Oakland eight days ago. </P> <P> At 38 Navratilova is still a threat to win in singles or doubles. She moved fluidly and quickly light on her feet in thrashing Sanchez Vicario 6-1 in the first set in Oakland but blew chances to put the match away in the next two sets losing both in tiebreakers. </P> <P> That ability to finish off a match was part of what distinguished her from all other players over the past two decades. Chris Evert had that knack during her reign when she won 157 singles titles. But Evert never was much interested in doubles winning only seven titles. </P> <P> The closest any men have come to Navratilova's records were Jimmy Connors with 109 singles titles and Tom Okker with 78 doubles titles. </P> <P> Perhaps it was that sheer dominance by Navratilova over the years that brought her the emotional allegiance of so many fans. Or perhaps it was her honesty on all subjects most notably her lesbian lifestyle and political issues that won her respect. Or maybe it was simply the way she played all or nothing on the court charging bravely and repeatedly to the net to force the attack displaying an attitude that tennis sage Ted Tinling once said ``ranged from arrogance to panic with nothing in between.'' </P> <P> Whatever it's been the public's attitude toward her certainly has changed. </P> <P> ``If you go back 10-15 years ago it wasn't anything like that '' said Pam Shriver her former doubles partner. ``But they grew to know her and the barriers came down -- the barriers of someone with a funny name and a funny accent with a different lifestyle with muscles and going against Chris Evert who was ... Chris Evert. </P> <P> ``There were a lot of reasons why there wasn't a connection early on but there were all those reasons in the end for those barriers to come down. </P> <P> ``People got to understand her better. ... In the end they saw enough of her emotion on the court and they got to know her history. ... The next thing you know people feel they grew up with Martina.'' </P>,Canada,Netherlands; Japan; France; Germany,0.003219342, , ,

Koos Sol said Monday that Bosnian Serb soldiers had pushed the mostly Muslim government army to positions about 10 kilometers (six miles) east of Bihac about 13 kilometers (eight miles) from the Croatian border. </P> <P> That was near the frontline which existed before government forces launched their offensive last month. </P> <P> But Bosnian army sources and confidential U.N. reports obtained by The Associated Press indicated that government forces still maintained key defensive positions.

However Darkic's statement fell short of an unequivocal pledge to send Croatian troops into Bosnia-Herzegovina. </P> <P> Such a move could prompt Serbia to enter the conflict and plunge the Balkans into a general war. </P> <P> ``We hope therefore that the international community will act and that direct assistance of the Croatian army to the Bosnian government will not be necessary '' Darkic was quoted as saying. </P> <P> The Security Council on Sunday demanded that Croatian Serbs stop cross-border attacks. </P> <P> In fighting in the southwest the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA quoted military sources as saying a government offensive in the Nevesinje region southeast of Mostar had been stopped. </P> <P> But Gen.

APW_ENG_19941114.0550,11/6/2004, <P> U.S. and French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario unbeaten in 21 straight matches during a sweep of four tournaments succumbed to Julie Halard on Monday night in the first round of the Virginia Slims Championships. </P> <P> Halard's 6-2 1-6 7-6 (6-2) win derailed Sanchez Vicario's bid to overtake Steffi Graf for the No. 1 ranking and opened a golden opportunity for retiring Martina Navratilova if she survives her first-round match Tuesday night against Gabriela Sabatini. </P> <P> For Sanchez Vicario it was a bitter end to her most successful year and it stopped her from becoming the first player in women's tennis to earn dlrs 3 million in a season. She wound up with just under dlrs 2.2 million. Graf earned a record dlrs 2.8 million last year. </P> <P> ``I'm not a machine and you can never win everything '' Sanchez Vicario said. ``She played better than me and she took more risks. She's a dangerous player but usually she's not so consistent. You never know what she can do. She can make all the shots or she can miss all the shots. Tonight she made them.'' </P> <P> Halard who pressured the Spaniard with daring shots into the corners in the first set looked weary and beaten in the second set as Sanchez Vicario changed her tactics a little and approached the net more. </P> <P> But Halard refused to quit against the player who had beaten her six of their seven previous matches and pushed the third set into a tiebreaker. </P> <P> The pivotal point in the tiebreaker came at 2-2 with Halard serving. A backhand approach by Halard was called long by the linesman but the umpire overruled the call and ordered the point replayed. Halard then served an ace for 3-2 as Sanchez Vicario looked on annoyed. </P> <P> That was followed by one of the finest points of the match. Halard charged in to scoop up a drop shot with a backhand Sanchez Vicario drilled a forehand crosscourt and Halard lunged for a forehand volley winner. </P> <P> An error by Sanchez Vicario on the next point made it 5-2 and Halard served out the match with the help of two more weak shots by Sanchez Vicario the last a forehand return dumped into the net. </P> <P> Halard hoped she'd have a chance to play Navratilova in her last tournament. </P> <P> ``It would be a great match '' Halard said. ``It's the last time to play her.'' </P> <P> No tennis player ever came close to Navratilova's combination of championships in singles -- a record 167 -- and doubles -- another record 165.

APW_ENG_19941114.0557,3/31/2004, <P> Pursuing freer trade around the Pacific Rim President Clinton joined Asian leaders Tuesday for far-reaching economic discussions. He hopes to make Asian markets ``as open to our products as ours are to theirs.'' </P> <P> After securing pledges of support from China Japan and South Korea on his North Korean initiatives Clinton and other leaders from the 18-nation APEC got down to the business of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum -- trade. </P> <P> The leaders each wearing a traditional open-neck batik shirts were welcomed by Indonesian President Suharto at an 18th Century Dutch colonial palace painted snowy white and surrounded by immaculate gardens. They sat in armed chairs without a table and stood for photos on a palace viranda. </P> <P> Later Tuesday the leaders were expected to endorse a blueprint for a free-trade pact that could reduce trade barriers across the Pacific Rim over the next quarter-century. </P> <P> The vaguely worded statement calls for ``open and free trade'' throughout the region by the year 2020. Industrial countries would try to achieve the goal by 2010 while less-developed countries and newly developed nations would get another 10 years. No formal treaty -- or binding commitments -- are expected to result from the meetings. </P> <P> Cautioning against immediate results Clinton said at a news conference Monday ``The American people cannot be as prosperous as they need to be unless we're successful here in Asia.'' </P> <P> He said his long-range goal was to get Asian markets ``as open to our products as ours are to theirs. I think Americans would like that.'' </P> <P> The major trading powers in the Pacific basin are convinced that growth and prosperity depend on the removal of barriers to trade and investment Indonesia's President Suharto said at a Monday night banquet. </P> <P> ``In spite of the tremendous diversity of our cultures political systems and the stages of development of our economies we have been able to envision a community of Asia Pacific economies imbued with a growing spirit of partnership '' Suharto said. </P> <P> APEC has a combined population of 2.2 billion and gross output of dlrs 12 trillion. It accounts for half of the world's gross product and 41 percent of international trade and is the world's fastest-growing economic region. U.S. trade across the Pacific is three times as large as that with European nations. </P> <P> In a show of unity before the trade sessions began China Japan and South Korea agreed to keep the pressure on North Korea to freeze its suspected nuclear weapons program. </P> <P> Clinton after one-on-one talks with presidents and prime ministers Monday said North Korea's neighbors offered ``their strong support'' for the accord to freeze and ultimately dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear program. </P> <P> China South Korea and Japan already had endorsed the North Korean agreement but Clinton showcased the issue because many details of how to implement the pact over 10 years remain to be worked out. </P> <P> Clinton said the plan -- providing North Korea with alternate fuels and new light-water reactors for giving up its nuclear program -- would ``require a lot of efforts on several fronts.'' </P> <P> Perhaps the thorniest question is how to divide the estimated dlrs 4 billion cost of the deal. Japan and South Korea are expected to shoulder most of the burden. </P> <P> Clinton met twice Monday with Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and South Korean President Kim Young-Sam an effort aimed at helping the pair sell the deal at home. </P> <P> On his second trip abroad in recent weeks Clinton was closely questioned by his foreign counterparts on last week's GOP election sweep.

Food and medical supplies were being rushed to the island on four military helicopters. </P> <P> The quake which occurred at 3:15 a.m. (14:15 Monday GMT) had a preliminary magnitude of 7 and was centered in a strait 10 kilometers (six miles) north of Calapan a town on the northern end of the island said the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology. Calapan is less than 5 kilometers (3 miles) east of Malaylay. </P> <P> Lasting about four minutes the quake was felt at intensities of 3 and 4 throughout central and south Philippines including Manila 75 miles (120 kilometers) north of the epicenter said Ted Sandoval a specialist at the institute.

APW_ENG_19941115.0008,12/1/2004, <P> For President Suharto laying out the welcome mat for President Clinton and other Asia and Pacific leaders Tuesday marked a triumph for a leader who has long struggled to win international prestige. </P> <P> Suharto's military-backed government has been embarrassed by a highly visible pro-independence protest in the province of East Timor and President Clinton has promised to raise that and other human-rights issues in one-on-one talks with the Indonesian leader on Wednesday. </P> <P> Even so Indonesia's hosting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit turned the spotlight on decades of fiscal stewardship by Suharto that lifted the world's fourth most populous country out of dire poverty and made into one of the region's fastest-growing economies. </P> <P> ``This is a culmination for him a chance to point to his economic accomplishments '' said Douglas Ramage a research fellow specializing in Indonesia at Honolulu's East-West Center. </P> <P> Suharto 73 has wielded power for nearly 30 years making him one of the world's longest-ruling leaders. Last year he began his sixth and likely final presidential term which ends in 1993. </P> <P> Suharto took power in the wake of an abortive 1965 coup against the nation's founding leader President Sukarno. Inheriting a country beset by food shortages and triple-digit inflation he made fiscal concerns his top priority. </P> <P> In a country that sprawls over nearly 14 000 islands and encompasses hundreds of ethnic groups Suharto also sought to quell volatile regional divisions military factionalism and a confrontational stance toward neighboring Malaysia. </P> <P> But stability has come at a price. Indonesia has been consistently criticized by human rights groups who point to crackdowns on labor activists repression of the press and a bloody massacre of protesters in East Timor three years ago. </P> <P> The Suharto-Clinton meeting may have some tense moments if these subjects </P> <P> are raised. But although divided by culture ideology and a generation gap the two leaders do have some things in common including a childhood marked by turmoil and early loss. </P> <P> Born into a peasant family in rural Java Suharto was 2 when his parents divorced and he spent his youth shuffled among various relatives. </P> <P> Like Clinton he was an ambitious young man who made his way up from rural poverty. He once lost a job as an apprentice bank clerk because while bicycling he ripped his only sarong the traditional Javanese garb required in his job. </P> <P> He found his calling in the military and his will was tested by guerrilla warfare in the Javanese jungle during the war for independence from the Dutch. He rose through the ranks and was a general at the time of the anti-Sukarno coup by another military faction. </P> <P> Surprising even his associates Suharto stepped to the fore and over the next two years relentlessly pushed Sukarno aside. </P> <P> Suharto presents a sharp contrast to his predecessor the only other leader Indonesia has ever known. </P> <P> Sukarno was a fiery nationalist always seen in uniform a captivating orator believed by many Indonesians to possess the mystical powers of a god-king. Suharto by contrast has a deliberate even plodding manner of speaking and eschews military dress. </P> <P> If the APEC meeting and separate talks with Clinton mark a triumph for Suharto they could also add fuel to speculation over who will succeed him. </P> <P> ``On the one hand being in the spotlight just now strengthens him. He can say `Look the world is coming to us ''' said Ramage the Indonesia researcher. </P> <P> ``On the other hand people are increasingly saying `OK fine we've made all this economic progress we've had stability we have respect. But now it's time for democracy for change.'' </P>,Malaysia,Indonesia,0.200000003,-0.200000003,0.000742786, 
APW_ENG_19941115.0018,3/21/2005, <P> President Clinton joined leaders of other Pacific and Asian powers Tuesday in a former Dutch colonial palace to set a timetable for ending trade barriers across the economically dynamic region within 25 years. </P> <P> The president was pressing for a formula under which big industrial economies of the Pacific Rim would drop trade barriers by no later than 2010 with the rest of the region joining in by 2020. </P> <P> ``This is a good investment we need to make the most of it '' Clinton declared in advance of the opening of the session at Bogor Palace. </P> <P> As the leaders of the 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference met all attired in multicolored Indonesian batik shirts custom-made for the occasion U.S. officials expressed optimism that the conference would embrace the U.S. formula by day's end. </P> <P> And while the proposed declaration leaves a lot of latitude and wiggle-room for reluctant partners like China and Malaysia it marks a step toward what could develop into the world's largest free-trade zone. </P> <P> One third of U.S. exports already go to nations of the region. China has become the world's third largest economy and other nations of the region are also rapidly expanding into huge markets. </P> <P> For a president reeling under last week's midterm elections which handed control of Congress to Republicans for the first time in 40 years the APEC conference was a new chance to demonstrate leadership on the world stage. </P> <P> The Asian and Pacific heads of state met in Bogor Palace a white stucco structure surrounded by lush lawns and gardens that was built as a summer retreat by Indonesia's former Dutch colonial governors. Deer scattered as motorcade after motorcade arrived at the palace about 40 miles south of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. </P> <P> Each of the leaders was wearing a batik silk shirt in the traditional Indonesian style a gift from Indonesian President Suharto. </P> <P> The two-tier timetable was proposed by Indonesia as a compromise and embraced by both the United States and Japan. </P> <P> The United States originally wanted to set a goal of free and open trade and investment through the region by 2010 but China and Indonesia -- concerned about too much U.S. influence over their economic decisions -- balked. </P> <P> Myers said Clinton was pressing for ``reciprocity '' meaning that the United States would not lower trade barriers with any particular nation in the region until that nation lowered its trade barriers with the United States. </P> <P> ``I think most Americans would like it very much to know that at some date certain that every market in this part of the world the fastest growing part of the world...would be as open to our products as our markets are to theirs '' Clinton said Monday at a news conference. </P> <P> His wife Hillary Rodham Clinton meanwhile continued her separate schedule. Today she was touring Yogyakarta a 45-minute flight from Jakarta site of the world's largest Buddhist monument a village health care post and other sights. </P> <P> On Monday she toured a cultural park in Jakarta and took in a fashion show. </P> <P> Today's conference was a follow-up to one hosted last year by Clinton in Seattle that drew the Asian-Pacific heads of state together for the first time ever to discuss economic issues. </P> <P> Next year Japan will play host to the APEC summit. Clinton already has said he will attend. </P> <P> The summit was marred by continuing demonstrations against Indonesia's occupation of the former Portuguese colony of East Timor. </P> <P> About 90 demonstrators were arrested Monday in clashes between soldiers and pro-independence protesters in Dili East Timor's capital. And a group of student protesters who scaled a fence at the U.S. embassy in Jakarta maintained their sit-in in the embassy's parking lot. </P>,China,Japan; Malaysia; Indonesia,0.200000003,0.048899602, ,

APW_ENG_19941115.0056,3/18/2005, Heavy rains and flooding from Tropical Storm Gordon swept across Haiti yesterday killing at least 100 people leaving thousands homeless and posing yet another challenge to the young democratic government. Communications were down through most of rural Haiti and rescue workers feared the nationwide death toll was much higher. President Jean-Bertrand Aristide flew over his battered Caribbean nation in a U-S military helicopter to survey damage from the 1994 Atlantic hurricane season's deadliest storm which triggered landslides and washed away makeshift homes overnight. ``I didn't save anything only myself '' said Lekeas Dorvilier 35 who jumped out the window of his two-room home minutes before it crumbled into a ravine. Many of the victims lived in flimsy tin shacks in slums on hillsides in the capital. By noon the main morgue in Port-au-Prince had received 18 victims of the flooding. Argentine police monitors unloaded one body caked with sand from their jeep. ST. KITTS: Government Finds Site To Relocate Inmates: BASSETERRE St. Kitts (AP) -- Scotland Yard pathologists were performing tests yesterday to determine whether two bodies found in the trunk of a burned-out car were those of the missing son of the deputy prime minister and his girlfriend. Meanwhile one prisoner remained at large in the wake of a prison riot and fire last Friday sparked by the controversial release on bail of Deputy Prime Minister Sidney Morris' other two sons on drug charges. Vincent Morris 36 and his girlfriend Joan Walsh 35 have been missing since Oct. 1. Police found the corpses believed to be theirs in Morris' burned-out car in a sugar cane field Saturday. Shortly after the couple disappeared St. Kitts police and Scotland Yard detectives found parts of a large shipment of cocaine into former British colony in Morris' home hidden on a nearby beach and buried on a nearby farm. Jude Matthew the top police official searching for Morris and Walsh was slain October 13th in a related incident. More than 100 prisoners broke out and the prison was destroyed during the riot and fire. Most of the inmates remained at the prison compound but 18 escaped. Police captured 10 and seven returned voluntarily Sunday night leaving one at large. DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Government To Allow Entrance Of 1 500 Cubans: SANTO DOMINGO Dominican Republic (AP) -- Some 1 500 Cubans who have Dominican visas bought by relatives in Miami will be allowed to travel here Chancellor Carlos Morales Troncoso announced yesterday. Morales Troncoso said the Cubans would be allowed to come here but only in small groups. ``We have authorized the entrance to a group of 75 Cubans '' he said. The government of President Joaquin Balaguer banned the massive entrance of Cuban immigrants after officials found out that a smuggling ring was buying visas in the Dominican Republic and selling them in Miami for $3 000. Dominican visas are issued by the Ministry for about $20 a fee that includes stamps and forms. Most of the Cubans who came here last year with visas acquired in Miami traveled in boats to Miami or to neighboring Puerto Rico to seek U-S asylum. President Clinton reversed the U-S policy of giving asylum to Cuban refugees coming to the United States after Cuban President Fidel Castro dropped shore patrols in early August producing the biggest exodus of Cubans since the 1980 Mariel boatlift.

APW_ENG_19941115.0068,11/22/2006, <P> After weeks of military defeats Bosnian Serbs have driven government troops in northern Bosnia nearly back to front lines that existed before a fall government offensive reignited the war. </P> <P> Croatia meanwhile called on the United Nations to protect the area near its border. </P> <P> U.N. spokesman Maj. Koos Sol said Monday that Bosnian Serb soldiers had pushed the mostly Muslim government army to positions about six miles east of Bihac which is near the Croatian border. </P> <P> But Bosnian army sources and confidential U.N. reports obtained by The Associated Press indicated that government forces still held key defensive positions. There was no indication that Bihac was in imminent danger of falling. </P> <P> Rugged terrain stands between the Bosnian Serbs and the city of Bihac which the U.N. Security Council declared a safe area in 1993. </P> <P> Bosnian radio said four rockets fired from Bosnian Serb territory hit the Cazin region north of Bihac causing casualties and heavy damage. The United Nations said several ground-to-air missiles were fired by Bosnian Serbs at Cazin and Bihac. </P> <P> Government troops defending Bihac are sandwiched between Bosnian Serb soldiers and rebel Serbs to the north and west in Croatia. </P> <P> Croatian Serbs captured a third of Croatia in 1991 and their involvement in the Bihac fighting could give the Croatian government an opportunity to attack the rebels and regain their land. </P> <P> However State Department officials said the United States has tried to discourage Croatia from getting involved militarily to avoid an escalation in the war. </P> <P> The officials speaking on condition of anonymity said Croatia seriously considered joining the fighting but now was leaning against it. Such a move could prompt Serbia to enter the conflict and plunge the Balkans into a general war. </P> <P> ``We hope therefore that the international community will act and that direct assistance of the Croatian army to the Bosnian government will not be necessary '' Darko Bekic a Croatian diplomat was quoted as saying Monday. </P> <P> The Security Council on Sunday demanded that Croatian Serbs stop cross-border attacks. </P> <P> Fighting has flared throughout Bosnia for several weeks. A Muslim-Bosnian Croat alliance captured the central Bosnian city of Kupres this month the Serbs' worst defeat since they went to war in 1992 after Bosnia seceded from Yugoslavia. </P> <P> More than 200 000 people have been killed or are missing in the fighting. </P> <P> In a related development NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes travels to Washington on Wednesday to discuss the Clinton administration's move to stop enforcing an international arms ban for the Bosnian government side. </P> <P> The United States says the ban should be lifted because Bosnian Serbs have rejected an international peace plan for months.

APW_ENG_19941115.0073,12/9/2005, <P> Leaders of Pacific and Asian powers agreed Tuesday to end all trade barriers throughout the economically dynamic region within 25 years. ``We have set a course for the future '' said Indonesian President Suharto. </P> <P> The timetable to end trade barriers among 18 Pacific Rim nations calls for the biggest industrial economies to drop trade barriers by 2010. Most of the rest of the region would get another 10 years until 2020. </P> <P> A last-minute deal was struck to give China and South Korea and other fast-growing Asian economies until 2020 to ease trade restrictions rather than the earlier date. Clinton had pressed for more countries particularly South Korea to come in by 2010 but agreed to the compromise. </P> <P> While the declaration leaves a lot of latitude and wiggle-room for reluctant partners in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum it marks a step toward what could develop into the world's largest free-trade zone. </P> <P> ``We agree to adopt the long term goal of free and open trade and investment in Asia Pacific. This goal will be pursued promptly by further reducing barriers to trade and investment and by promoting the free flow of goods service and capital among our economies '' the APEC leaders said in a joint declaration. </P> <P> ``We wish to emphasize our strong opposition to the creation of an inward- looking trading block that would divert from the pursuit of global free trade '' the declaration added. </P> <P> The declaration said that the different pace of lowering trade barriers with the largest economies doing it first reflects ``the different levels of economic development among APEC economies.'' </P> <P> Suharto in a news conference at the conclusion of the leaders' meeting said the issue of human rights was not discussed. And he flatly refused to answer a reporter's question on alleged Indonesian human rights violations in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor. He said it would take too longer to answer the question. </P> <P> The main topic he said was the effort to remove trade barriers in the Asia and Pacific region and to enhance regional cooperation on such matters as the environment and economic development. </P> <P> Asked what assurances he could make that real progress would be made within the timetable Suharto said obliquely ``We have to work hard and we have to make concrete steps.'' He said the 25-year timetable may be stepped up. </P> <P> When asked about human rights in Indonesia and elsewhere Suharto said ``We may have differences but we are taking up these issues based on the principle of mutual respect.'' He refused to answer a question about East Timor a former Portuguese colony that Indonesia annexed in 1976.

But no damage or injuries were reported very far outside the quake zone. </P> <P> Throughout the day several of the 888 aftershocks jarred Mindoro Island again startling many residents. </P> <P> ``We are afraid of the sea '' said Francisca Pascua 48 as she walked toward two shelters that were quickly set up in a high school gym and on a hilly field near a hospital in the town of Calapan. She was with her four daughters and two grandchildren. </P> <P> Many other shellshocked people also fled Malaylay the hardest hit village where at least 25 people died. </P> <P> For Purina Rosales the nightmare began there when the quake leveled her bamboo home and the tidal wave struck.

Mrs. Rosales screamed as she knelt in a one-room schoolhouse where they and 13 other bodies had been placed on benches. ``Why didn't you use your strength and swim?'' she cried to her husband. </P> <P> Like other survivors in the village of huts and dirt roads Mrs. Rosales said she grabbed one of the area's many coconut trees when she was swept away by the tidal wave. </P> <P> In Malaylay and other fishing villages several typhoons including the strongest one last month had kept many fishermen at home but none of their homes was destroyed. That all changed Tuesday with the quake and tidal wave. </P> <P> President Fidel Ramos who was at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Indonesia sent dlrs 208 000 to help rebuild the homes. Military helicopters also were rushing in food drinking water and medical supplies. </P> <P> The earthquake cut off electricity to most of Mindoro Island and destroyed many of its water mains said Valencia. </P> <P> The quake had a magnitude of 7.1 and was centered in a strait six miles (10 kilometers) north of the island. </P> <P> Ted Sandoval a Filipino seismologist said the temblor was one of the strongest ever to occur on the active Lubang fault. </P> <P> A magnitude 6 quake can cause severe damage if centered under a populated area while magnitude 7 indicates a major quake capable of widespread heavy damage. </P> <P> The Philippines a Pacific archipelago of 7 100 mountainous islands sits on at least four major faults.

They say he died of a heroin overdose. </P> <P> But the British Foreign Office in London said the body found in Hat Yai was not that of Rowe whose name was originally spelled as Roe. </P> <P> ``I'm not sure if it's a case of mistaken identity or fraudulent identity '' a Foreign Office spokesman said requesting customary anonymity. </P> <P> Police went to Rowe's home in England to inform his family that he had been found dead in Thailand only to find that he was alive and had just stepped out to a betting shop. </P> <P> ``I couldn't believe it when police came around to the house to tell me George was dead '' his wife Eileen Rowe said. ``If I hadn't seen him in the morning before he went out I would have ended up believing it myself.'' </P> <P> The Foreign Office said the real identity of the dead man was not known and an investigation was underway. </P> <P> Queried whether a passport forgery could have been involved the Hat Yai police station said the face of the dead man matched the photograph in the passport and they had no other information about him except what was contained in the passport. </P> <P> The police said the body would be handed over to the British Embassy in Thailand for repatriation. </P> <P> The police said the passport showed the man entered Thailand Nov. 4 and then crossed the nearby border into Malaysia May 10 returning to Thailand the same day. </P> <P> Foreigners with forged travel documents are frequently apprehended in Thailand.

APW_ENG_19941115.0155,8/11/2005, <P> Fifty years ago Julia Gati her elderly mother and her 16-month-old son were rounded up with the rest of Budapest's Jews and herded into a ghetto where 20 000 people including her mother later perished. </P> <P> ``My mother died there she starved to death '' the 72-year-old retired school teacher said on Tuesday 50 years after Hungary's Nazi puppet regime created the Budapest Ghetto. ``I have no idea how we survived. It was a miracle.'' </P> <P> The 50th anniversary passed almost unnoticed. Only one newspaper -- the liberal Magyar Hirlap -- noted the date and in a story what it meant to the city. But there were no official commemorations planned by city authorities. </P> <P> The deputy leader of Hungary's Jewish community Rabbi Ernoe Lazarovits said Jews would never commemorate such a hated date but he acknowledged he wasn't even sure what day the barricades went up around Budapest's Jewish quarter. </P> <P> World War II was almost over when fascists opposed to the government's attempt to end its alliance with Nazi Germany overthrew Regent Miklos Horthy. </P> <P> Together with the occupying Germans they herded about 70 000 of Budapest's Jews mostly women children and elderly into the ghetto set up around the main Budapest synagogue. </P> <P> Between Nov. 15 1944 and Jan. 18 1945 when the Soviet Red Army liberated the ghetto approximately 20 000 Jews died in the ghetto either of starvation disease or exposure or at the hands of gangs working for Hungary's fascist ``Arrow Cross'' regime. </P> <P> Even before the Jewish ghetto was created in Budapest almost 90 percent of Hungary's Jews were deported to death camps after the Germans occupied Hungary in March 1944. Adolf Eichmann Hitler's henchman testified at his war crimes trial that the Arrow Cross was more efficient than the Gestapo responsible for sending 600 000 Jews to their deaths in less than five months. </P> <P> ``I was there with my toddler son we had no food no water no heating '' Mrs. Gati recalled in an interview with The Associated Press. </P> <P> Mrs. Gati's 66-year-old mother Margit Kohn died of starvation in December 1944. ``But my son and I survived thanks to the Russians who gave us food and drink '' she said. </P> <P> The fact that her little son could survive such horror made Mrs. Gati religious which she had not been before the war. </P> <P> ``Until then I hadn't believed in God but since that time I've been a true believer '' Mrs. Gati said. Her son Gabor also lives in Budapest. </P> <P> Budapest's Jewish ghetto was one of the few throughout Europe left intact after the war. Although it was mined the Nazis did not have time to blow it up because the Red Army was advancing. About 50 000 Jews were liberated. </P> <P> An estimated 100 000 Jews most of them in Budapest live in Hungary the largest Jewish community in Eastern Europe. The former Budapest ghetto is a dingy collection of gray neglected old tenements but aside from a small plaque near the synagogue bears little witness to the Holocaust there. </P>,Hungary,Germany,1.700000048,-0.200000003,0.018137574,

APW_ENG_19941115.0157,5/8/2006, <P> For President Suharto laying out the welcome mat for President Clinton and other Asia and Pacific leaders Tuesday marked a triumph for a leader who has long struggled to win international prestige. </P> <P> Suharto's military-backed government has been embarrassed by a highly visible pro-independence protest in the province of East Timor and President Clinton has promised to raise that and other human-rights issues in one-on-one talks with the Indonesian leader on Wednesday. </P> <P> Even so Indonesia's hosting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit turned the spotlight on decades of fiscal stewardship by Suharto that lifted the world's fourth most populous country out of dire poverty and made into one of the region's fastest-growing economies. </P> <P> ``This is a culmination for him a chance to point to his economic accomplishments '' said Douglas Ramage a research fellow specializing in Indonesia at Honolulu's East-West Center. </P> <P> Suharto 73 has wielded power for nearly 30 years making him one of the world's longest-ruling leaders. Last year he began his sixth and likely final presidential term which ends in 1998. </P> <P> Suharto took power in the wake of an abortive 1965 coup against the nation's founding leader President Sukarno. Inheriting a country beset by food shortages and triple-digit inflation he made fiscal concerns his top priority. </P> <P> In a country that sprawls over nearly 14 000 islands and encompasses hundreds of ethnic groups Suharto also sought to quell volatile regional divisions military factionalism and a confrontational stance toward neighboring Malaysia. </P> <P> But stability has come at a price. Indonesia has been consistently criticized by human rights groups who point to crackdowns on labor activists repression of the press and a bloody massacre of protesters in East Timor three years ago. </P> <P> The Suharto-Clinton meeting may have some tense moments if these subjects are raised. But although divided by culture ideology and a generation gap the two leaders do have some things in common including a childhood marked by turmoil and early loss. </P> <P> Born into a peasant family in rural Java Suharto was 2 when his parents divorced and he spent his youth shuffled among various relatives. </P> <P> Like Clinton he was an ambitious young man who made his way up from rural poverty. He once lost a job as an apprentice bank clerk because while bicycling he ripped his only sarong the traditional Javanese garb required in his job. </P> <P> He found his calling in the military and his will was tested by guerrilla warfare in the Javanese jungle during the war for independence from the Dutch. He rose through the ranks and was a general at the time of the anti-Sukarno coup by another military faction. </P> <P> Surprising even his associates Suharto stepped to the fore and over the next two years relentlessly pushed Sukarno aside. </P> <P> Suharto presents a sharp contrast to his predecessor the only other leader Indonesia has ever known. </P> <P> Sukarno was a fiery nationalist always seen in uniform a captivating orator believed by many Indonesians to possess the mystical powers of a god-king. Suharto by contrast has a deliberate even plodding manner of speaking and eschews military dress. </P> <P> If the APEC meeting and separate talks with Clinton mark a triumph for Suharto they could also add fuel to speculation over who will succeed him. </P> <P> ``On the one hand being in the spotlight just now strengthens him. He can say `Look the world is coming to us ''' said Ramage the Indonesia researcher. </P> <P> ``On the other hand people are increasingly saying `OK fine we've made all this economic progress we've had stability we have respect. But now it's time for democracy for change.'' </P>,Malaysia,Indonesia,0.200000003,-0.200000003,0.000743024,

APW_ENG_19941115.0185,5/28/2006, <P> Hundreds of people who survived a typhoon in their seaside villages last month gave up and fled the area Tuesday after a strong earthquake and a tidal wave destroyed everything they had left on their central Philippine island. </P> <P> Carrying bags of food and clothing on their heads and shoulders at least 450 people walked down tar roads with huge cracks left in them by the quake that struck before dawn. </P> <P> At least 45 people were killed on the northern coast of Mindoro Island 135 injured and eight left missing and as many as 200 homes were destroyed said Rodolfo Valencia one of its two governors. Most of the deaths came in the 5-foot (1.5-meter)-tall tidal wave. </P> <P> Yuji Murata 41 a scientist studying orchids for the Japanese government was trapped by landslides along with three Filipino guides on a 5 000-foot (1 525-meter) mountain local people said. </P> <P> The quake struck the island's Oriental Mindaro province the day it planned to celebrate the 44th anniversary of its founding and people planning a parade spent the day helping survivors. </P> <P> When the quake struck at 3:15 a.m. it was felt throughout the central and southern Philippines and rocked skyscrapers and tall hotels in Manila 75 miles (120 kilometers) north of the epicenter. But no damage or injuries were reported very far outside the quake zone. </P> <P> Throughout the day several of the 888 aftershocks jarred Mindoro Island again startling many residents. </P> <P> ``We are afraid of the sea '' said Francisca Pascua 48 as she walked toward two shelters that were quickly set up in a high school gym and on a hilly field near a hospital in the town of Calapan. She was with her four daughters and two grandchildren. </P> <P> Many other shellshocked people also fled Malaylay the hardest hit village where at least 25 people died. </P> <P> For Purina Rosales the nightmare began there when the quake leveled her bamboo home and the tidal wave struck. A few hours later she found the bodies of Eduardo her husband and Alesa her 4-year-old daughter a long way away. </P> <P> ``I need you! I need you!'' Mrs. Rosales screamed as she knelt in a one-room schoolhouse where they and 13 other bodies had been placed on benches. ``Why didn't you use your strength and swim?'' she cried to her husband. </P> <P> Like other survivors in the village of huts and dirt roads Mrs. Rosales said she grabbed one of the area's many coconut trees when she was swept away by the tidal wave. </P> <P> In Malaylay and other fishing villages several typhoons including the strongest one last month had kept many fishermen at home but none of their homes was destroyed. That all changed Tuesday with the quake and tidal wave. </P> <P> President Fidel Ramos who was at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Indonesia sent dlrs 208 000 to help rebuild the homes. Military helicopters also were rushing in food drinking water and medical supplies. </P> <P> The earthquake cut off electricity to most of Mindoro Island and destroyed many of its water mains said Valencia. </P> <P> The quake had a magnitude of 7.1 and was centered in a strait six miles (10 kilometers) north of the island. </P> <P> Ted Sandoval a Filipino seismologist said the temblor was one of the strongest ever to occur on the active Lubang fault. </P> <P> A magnitude 6 quake can cause severe damage if centered under a populated area while magnitude 7 indicates a major quake capable of widespread heavy damage. </P> <P> The Philippines a Pacific archipelago of 7 100 mountainous islands sits on at least four major faults.

Newt Gingrich of Georgia and other Republican leaders said Monday. </P> <P> Gingrich and hundreds of his party colleagues made a campaign pledge to have votes on the measures within 100 days of taking control of the House. </P> <P> ``We're going to transform the federal government '' Gingrich told a dinner attended by contributors to his political action committee. ``We're going to ask of every dollar `Is this better spent by a bureaucrat or by you?''' </P> <P> President Clinton meanwhile said on Friday in Jakarta Indonesia that he and the Republicans should be able to produce a bipartisan welfare reform plan and work together on a line item veto and reducing the size of government. </P> <P> ``We do need a lot more changes and we can do them together if we are determined to put America first and not put partisanship first '' said Clinton after an economic summit with leaders of countries from both sides of the Pacific. He reserved judgment on the idea of a constitutional amendment to restore prayer in public school. </P> <P> Hillary Rodham Clinton meanwhile said regardless of last week's election returns ``I think the president has to stand for what he stood for and has to stick with his principles and protect the progress that has been made.'' </P> <P> ``I don't think the American public wants ... to see the gains in cutting the deficit reversed '' she told reporters in Indonesia. </P> <P> Taking heed of the new political landscape White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta planned an afternoon ``courtesy call'' to meet with Gingrich and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole on Capitol Hill. </P> <P> A week after the election that gave Republicans control of Congress for the first time since 1954 leaderless Democrats grappled among themselves over command of their minorities in the House and Senate come January. </P> <P> Outgoing Majority Leader Richard Gephardt D-Mo. was facing at least one challenger to be House minority leader but was the odds-on favorite. </P> <P> In the House moderate Rep. Charlie Rose D-N.C. said he would challenge Gephardt saying the party needed to move more toward the center and not automatically champion Clinton's causes. </P> <P> But the focus was on Republicans still jubilant over their Election Day stampede. The conservative Gingrich met with Dole on a sun-drenched Capitol balcony to discuss their plans for 1995. </P> <P> ``We need to coordinate whenever we can. That doesn't mean we are never going to disagree '' said Dole who is less ideological than the Georgian. </P> <P> Gingrich told nearly 200 campaign contributors that Republican ideas for cutting taxes shrinking the size of government and encouraging private initiative would pay off. </P> <P> ``If you'll take up the moral cause of re-establishing for every American the pursuit of happiness I believe within two or three years we'll have dramatically less drug addiction dramatically less alcoholism '' Gingrich said. </P> <P> At times the Republicans ambitious aims collided with themselves. </P> <P> Party leaders said they were weighing changes in the House schedule to make it easier on the personal lives of junior lawmakers with school-age children. But Rep. Richard Armey R-Texas the likely House majority leader described an early work schedule that sounded anything but family friendly. </P> <P> ``We will complete the contract within 100 days '' Armey said. ``If that means working seven days (a week) we'll work seven days.'' </P> <P> Gingrich's political action committee bowed to pressure and agreed to reveal the names of future contributors.

Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Monday night to say that he accepted is defeat. </P> <P> Dhlakama who had charged the vote was open to fraud and threatened to boycott reportedly told Boutros-Ghali that he was ``in favor of peace and national reconciliation'' and was ``prepared to cooperate with the government of Mozambique in the post-election era.'' </P> <P> The vote came two years after FRELIMO and RENAMO signed a treaty ending 15 years of civil war.

APW_ENG_19941115.0250,6/7/2006, <P> Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday said Islamic militants were using poverty to gain influence and warned that the peace process could collapse if donor nations don't make good on aid pledges. </P> <P> Arafat said that less than dlrs 40 million only 6 percent of the funds have come through while Islamic opponents of the peace process are receiving money from Iran Arab oil states and private donors in the United States. </P> <P> In an interview with The Associated Press and APTV Arafat said failure to meet Gaza's pressing economic needs could result in violence. </P> <P> ``More serious than that -- the explosion of the peace process '' he said. </P> <P> Arafat blamed Israel for spurring the cycle of violence. </P> <P> For example he said a suicide bomb attack that killed three Israeli soldiers near a Jewish settlement in Gaza on Friday was in response for the Nov. 2 car bomb assassination of an Islamic fundamentalist leader Hani Abed. </P> <P> ``Violence has two sides and the target is the peace of the brave '' said Arafat. </P> <P> The Palestinian leader said it was Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin who nurtured the radical Hamas movement as a rival to Arafat's PLO during the Palestinian uprising that began in December 1987 when Rabin was defense minister. </P> <P> ``It wasn't me who established and gave license to this movement. Israel's government gave them 700 licenses '' he said referring to permits Israel's military authorities issued for private schools clinics and other social centers. </P> <P> Rabin said Arafat has not done enough to prevent the spate of suicide attacks on Israelis carried out by Hamas and Islamic Jihad despite a Palestinian crackdown the past few days in the Gaza Strip. </P> <P> ``Continued terrorism by extreme Islamic groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad if it continues can put a question mark over the basis of the agreement between us '' Rabin said in a tour of army outposts protecting Jewish settlers in Gaza. </P> <P> Arafat who spoke a day after his PLO police stopped a rally by Islamic militants in honor of Abed said he was doing all he could ``to cool things down. But for how long?'' </P> <P> Arafat spoke in his small whitewashed office overlooking the Mediterranean Sea in a building that is still under construction. Members of his Cabinet sat in on the interview while soldiers armed with automatic rifles stood guard outside. </P> <P> Arafat arrived in a buoyant mood after addressing a rally of about 5 000 cheering supporters to mark Palestinian Independence Day. ``God willing next year we will celebrate independence in Jerusalem the capital of the Palestinian state '' he told the crowd gathered at the Yarmouk Stadium. </P> <P> He blamed donor nations for dragging their feet in delivering on their promise of dlrs 690 million in the first year of autonomy which began in May. </P> <P> ``Some international sources are behind all of this '' said Arafat who appeared to be alluding to the United States. </P> <P> He recalled telling President Clinton at the peace agreement signing ceremony in September 1993 that ``either we will have a new Somalia in the Middle East or another Singapore.'' </P> <P> He said that 58 per cent unemployment makes the Gaza Strip an explosive area. ``Some fanatic groups '' he said ``are using poverty'' as a cover for violence. </P> <P> Arafat said his administration needs more than what has already been pledged to rebuild the infrastructure of the Gaza Strip which he said was destroyed by 27 years of Israeli occupation. </P> <P> There is urgent need for ``schools hospitals housing water sewage an airport a harbor roads electricity and telecommunications.'' </P> <P> Arafat criticized Israel for stalling on plans for holding Palestinian elections for a self-rule council to govern the Gaza Strip and the West Bank until a permanent solution is negotiated. </P> <P> Noting that elections were originally scheduled for July Arafat said that he would like to see elections within a month and that European experts had been working with the PLO on arrangements and training. </P> <P> Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told the AP Monday that he hoped elections could be held by mid-1995. He said that the two sides were far apart on details such as the size and responsibility of the council as well as the role of Islamic militants who oppose the peace process. </P> <P> Arafat said the elections should be open to all including Islamic militants. ``In my opinion all of them will participate '' he said adding that the Israelis ``have to accept democracy.'' </P>,Singapore,Somalia; Israel,0.100000001,0.100000001,0.000257158,

It was not clear if any Turkish Cypriots or mainland troops were hurt on the other side. </P> <P> Elsewhere along the Green Line which slices the island into Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot sectors the rallies were relatively more peaceful. </P> <P> Thousands of Greek Cypriots had thronged to the demarcation line since the early morning to denounce the Turkish Cypriots' proclamation of independence on Nov. 15 1983. </P> <P> They were mainly students given time off from schools to stage the rallies which have become an annual ritual. </P> <P> Carrying Greek and Cypriot flags they gathered along the demarcation line policed by United Nations forces. </P> <P> In Dherynia the students broke through Greek Cypriot police lines and a human barrier created by U.N. soldiers. As they got close to the Turkish troops' front line the firing began. </P> <P> Undeterred by the warning shots the students began pelting the other side with stones and the Turkish troops responded in kind police spokesman Glafcos Xenos said. He said the injured students were taken to nearby hospitals but none of them was in serious condition. </P> <P> The Turkish Cypriot leadership blamed the Greek Cypriot side for the border incidents and U.N. peacekeepers for failing to provide adequate security measures. </P> <P> An official statement said that the Turkish Cypriot authorities notified the United Nations after four thousand students seized a watch tower broke its windows and hoisted a Greek flag. </P> <P> ``The Turkish Cypriots are determined to give an effective response to those who want to violate our borders '' the statement added. </P> <P> In the capital Nicosia about 3 000 demonstrated at the Ledra Palace crossing between the northern and southern sectors. </P> <P> But Greek Cypriot riot policemen manned barbed wire barricades and blocked repeated attempts by the youths to break into the buffer zone. </P> <P> Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in July 1974 in the wake of a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece. </P> <P> Some 200 000 Greek Cypriots fled the north or were forcibly evicted after the invasion. About 40 000 Turkish Cypriots moved to the occupied northern third of the island which proclaimed independence nine years later. Only Turkey has recognized the breakaway state. </P> <P> U.N. efforts to reunite the island in a bizonal federation have been blocked by Turkish demands for the recognition of the northern state and Ankara's rejection of Security Council resolutions including a call for the withdrawal of its forces from Cyprus. </P>,Greece,Turkey; Cyprus,0.200000003,-0.200000003,0.001711055, 
APW_ENG_19941115.0268,3/27/2005, <P> Austrian President Thomas Klestil addressing Israel's Parliament on Tuesday apologized for his country's role in the Nazi Holocaust and said Austrians for too long had failed to face the truth. </P> <P> ``No word of apology can ever expunge the agony of the Holocaust. On behalf of the Republic of Austria I bow my head with deep respect and profound emotion in front of the victims '' Klestil told the half-empty plenum. </P> <P> The speech capped Klestil's three-day visit to Israel the first by an Austrian head of state. </P> <P> The visit came after years of frosty relations during the 1986-92 presidency of Klestil's predecessor Kurt Waldheim who served as an officer in the German army during World War II and was posted in the Balkans near the site of Nazi atrocities. </P> <P> Austria for years rejected responsibility for the persecution of Jews on its territory arguing it was the first victim of German aggression. Austria was annexed by Hitler's Germany in 1938. </P> <P> Klestil said his countrymen were reappraising their past. </P> <P> ``Today we Austrians recognize that an acknowledgement of the full truth was long overdue '' Klestil told Parliament. </P> <P> ``We know full well that all too often we have only spoken of Austria as the first state to have lost its freedom and independence to (Germany) and far too seldom of the fact that many of the worst henchmen in the Nazi dictatorship were Austrians '' he continued. </P> <P> Many Austrians enthusiastically supported Hitler who was himself Austrian-born. Some 70 000 Austrian Jews were killed in the Holocaust and about 15 000 Jews live in the country today compared to the thriving community of about 180 000 before 1938. In all some six million Jews died in World War II. </P> <P> Israeli leaders said time was ripe for a new beginning. </P> <P> ``Austria of today does not again turn its face away from the past '' Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told Parliament. </P> <P> ``My friend Mr. President the previous generation carries the blame the present generation carries the responsibility. For the blame there is no forgetting no forgiveness no comfort.'' </P> <P> ``The responsibility is to build...another world that will save from our children and your children the horrors our fathers bore '' he added. </P> <P> Peres and Parliament Speaker Shevach Weiss a Holocaust survivor praised Klestil's efforts to help find Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon. Austria has ties with Iran the country Israel holds responsible for the fate of missing air force navigator Ron Arad. </P> <P> Parliament spokeswoman Sarah Yitzhaki said only 50 of the 120 lawmakers were present but insisted the low turnout was not politically motivated. She noted former speaker Dov Shilansky a Holocaust survivor who has refused to meet German politicians attended. </P> <P> The plenum has generally been full during speeches by foreign heads of state most recently when President Clinton visited last month. </P> <P> Klestil's visit was overshadowed by diplomatic wrangling over initially planned meetings with Palestinian officials. </P> <P> Israeli President Weizman reportedly threatened to boycott Klestil's visit if the Austrian accepted an invitation by PLO chief Yasser Arafat for a meeting in the autonomous Gaza Strip arguing Klestil's first visit to Israel was too important to be used for other purposes. </P> <P> Klestil told a news conference Tuesday he canceled a meeting with Arafat under pressure. </P> <P> ``I said...if it is made possible then I would see him meet with him where it is being arranged. But since it proved not to be possible I have not met with him.'' </P> <P> Arafat noted that earlier this year Israel also blocked Pakistan President Benazir Bhutto from visiting him in Gaza. </P> <P> ``He (Klestil) has an invitation and he is welcome to come if not now then after '' Arafat told The Associated Press. </P> <P> ``I hope they are not against my getting the Nobel Prize '' Arafat added with a smile. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin Peres and Arafat share this year's Nobel Peace Prize and are to travel to Olso on Dec. 10 to receive it. </P> <P> In a news conference Klestil and his foreign minister Alois Mock played down possible dangers of growing support for right-wing extremists in his country. </P> <P> The far-right Freedom Party which campaigned on anti-foreigner sentiment made significant gains in Oct. 9 parliamentary elections winning almost a quarter of the vote. </P> <P> Klestil was evasive when asked whether the Freedom Party might be asked to join a governing coalition. </P>,Lebanon,Austria; Pakistan; Israel; Germany,0.000435139, , , 
APW_ENG_19941115.0279,10/12/2006, <P> The vote that could mean peace at last for Mozambique has been followed by explosive rumors that critics say fan fears the country may sink back into instability. </P> <P> ``The strongest enterprise in the country seems to be the production of rumors and false documents '' said Aldo Ajello the chief United Nations envoy to Mozambique. ``We see a kind of strategy to mount tension and we'd like to ... try to stop it.'' </P> <P> In the weeks since the Oct. 27-29 election the independent weekly ``Savana'' reported that the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front known as FRELIMO committed election fraud while the weekly ``Domingo'' said the former rebel Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) is gearing up for war. </P> <P> ``Noticias '' which like Domingos is notoriously inaccurate and considered pro-FRELIMO alleged that there was an assassination attempt on rebel leader Afonso Dhlakama. </P> <P> RENAMO has denied newspaper reports that its troops are regrouping in their former bases in preparation for a return to war. </P> <P> During 15 years of civil war the rightist RENAMO was backed by the former white minority government in South Africa which worked to destabilize leftist black-led governments in the region. </P> <P> Leftist FRELIMO had banned opposition parties before embarking on democratic reform in 1989. </P> <P> The former enemies will dominate parliament together now under President Joaquim Chissano of FRELIMO and must cooperate to ensure stability. </P> <P> Foreign ambassadors to Mozambique have said rumors are undermining confidence in the peace process.

APW_ENG_19941115.0348,5/2/2006, <P> Israel should seek a complete separation from the Palestinians and even pay them to stay away from jobs in its territory the head of a prestigious think-tank said Tuesday. </P> <P> ``Closing all of the territories is the only solution to achieving security '' said Joseph Alpher head of Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies. </P> <P> Alpher was referring to the West Bank and Gaza Strip where nearly 2 million Palestinians live.

APW_ENG_19941115.0403,5/18/2005, <P> Austrian President Thomas Klestil addressing Israel's Parliament on Tuesday apologized for his country's role in the Nazi Holocaust and said Austrians for too long had failed to face the truth. </P> <P> ``No word of apology can ever expunge the agony of the Holocaust. On behalf of the Republic of Austria I bow my head with deep respect and profound emotion in front of the victims '' Klestil told the half-empty plenum. </P> <P> The speech capped Klestil's three-day visit to Israel the first by an Austrian head of state. </P> <P> The visit came after years of frosty relations during the 1986-92 presidency of Klestil's predecessor Kurt Waldheim who served as an officer in the German army during World War II and was posted in the Balkans near the site of Nazi atrocities. </P> <P> Austria for years rejected responsibility for the persecution of Jews on its territory arguing it was the first victim of German aggression. Austria was annexed by Hitler's Germany in 1938. </P> <P> Klestil said his countrymen were reappraising their past. </P> <P> ``Today we Austrians recognize that an acknowledgement of the full truth was long overdue '' Klestil told Parliament. </P> <P> ``We know full well that all too often we have only spoken of Austria as the first state to have lost its freedom and independence to (Germany) and far too seldom of the fact that many of the worst henchmen in the Nazi dictatorship were Austrians '' he continued. </P> <P> Many Austrians enthusiastically supported Hitler who was himself Austrian-born. Some 70 000 Austrian Jews were killed in the Holocaust and about 15 000 Jews live in the country today compared to the thriving community of about 180 000 before 1938. In all some six million Jews died in World War II. </P> <P> Israeli leaders said time was ripe for a new beginning. </P> <P> ``Austria of today does not again turn its face away from the past '' Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told Parliament. </P> <P> ``My friend Mr. President the previous generation carries the blame the present generation carries the responsibility. For the blame there is no forgetting no forgiveness no comfort.'' </P> <P> ``The responsibility is to build...another world that will save from our children and your children the horrors our fathers bore '' he added. </P> <P> Peres and Parliament Speaker Shevach Weiss a Holocaust survivor praised Klestil's efforts to help find Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon. Austria has ties with Iran the country Israel holds responsible for the fate of missing air force navigator Ron Arad. </P> <P> But some legislators were disappointed by Klestil's words. </P> <P> ``It was not enough for me '' said right-wing lawmaker Dov Shilansky a Holocaust survivor. ``I expected him to explicitly beg forgiveness and he didn't.'' </P> <P> Parliament spokeswoman Sarah Yitzhaki said only 50 of the 120 lawmakers were present but insisted the low turnout was not politically motivated. </P> <P> The plenum has generally been full during speeches by foreign heads of state most recently when President Clinton visited last month. </P> <P> Klestil's visit was overshadowed by diplomatic wrangling over initially planned meetings with Palestinian officials. </P> <P> Israeli President Weizman reportedly threatened to boycott Klestil's visit if the Austrian accepted an invitation by PLO chief Yasser Arafat for a meeting in the autonomous Gaza Strip arguing Klestil's first visit to Israel was too important to be used for other purposes. </P> <P> Klestil told a news conference Tuesday he canceled a meeting with Arafat under pressure. </P> <P> ``I said...if it is made possible then I would see him meet with him where it is being arranged. But since it proved not to be possible I have not met with him.'' </P> <P> Arafat noted that earlier this year Israel also blocked Pakistan President Benazir Bhutto from visiting him in Gaza. </P> <P> ``He (Klestil) has an invitation and he is welcome to come if not now then after '' Arafat told The Associated Press. </P> <P> ``I hope they are not against my getting the Nobel Prize '' Arafat added with a smile. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin Peres and Arafat share this year's Nobel Peace Prize and are to travel to Olso on Dec. 10 to receive it. </P> <P> In a news conference Klestil and his foreign minister Alois Mock played down possible dangers of growing support for right-wing extremists in his country. </P> <P> The far-right Freedom Party which campaigned on anti-foreigner sentiment made significant gains in Oct. 9 parliamentary elections winning almost a quarter of the vote. </P> <P> Klestil was evasive when asked whether the Freedom Party might be asked to join a governing coalition. </P>,Lebanon,Austria; Pakistan; Israel; Germany,0.000469779, , , 
APW_ENG_19941115.0405,8/5/2006, <P> A top Treasury official barred his investigators from assisting a criminal probe of Vietnam embargo violations and then took steps that compromised the case according to documents and government officials. </P> <P> The investigation fell apart despite evidence that banks and U.S. companies moved hundreds of thousands of dollars to Vietnam in apparent violation of the embargo. A subsequent audit verified the transactions. </P> <P> The probe stalled following actions in 1991 by R. Richard Newcomb director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control a Treasury Department agency. </P> <P> Newcomb's actions so angered front-line Customs Service agents who were running the probe that they sent written complaints to their superiors officials said. </P> <P> ``The letters stated flatly that Newcomb had compromised the investigation '' said one senior government official involved in the case who spoke only on condition of anonymity. </P> <P> Newcomb did not return more than a half-dozen phone calls to his office over the last month. </P> <P> A subordinate's handwritten notes obtained by The Associated Press state that shortly after his office became involved in the probe Newcomb instructed his agents to end their contact with federal prosecutors. He told them that he wanted the Customs Service the agency overseeing the case ``out of the loop.'' </P> <P> Without informing Customs officials Newcomb then sent a civil order to a key target of the probe Standard Chartered Bank instructing the New York bank to simply stop the activities that were under scrutiny. Angry Treasury officials speaking only on condition of anonymity said the civil order effectively tipped off the bank. </P> <P> At the time investigators were trying to determine whether American companies were providing money that moved through the bank to Vietnam officials familiar with the case told AP. </P> <P> Brian Kegelman head of marketing for Standard Chartered said Monday the bank would have no comment on the case. </P> <P> Newcomb's office was the government agency charged with enforcing the trade embargo imposed by the U.S. government against Vietnam after the war. That embargo was lifted earlier this year. Until then American companies were barred from doing any business with Vietnam. </P> <P> Newcomb's conduct is already being investigated by the U.S. attorney Treasury inspector general and congressional committees after an AP story in September cited documents suggesting he dragged his feet -- for political reasons -- in a criminal case involving Texaco and violations of the Haiti embargo. </P> <P> Acting on information that apparently emerged from an earlier undercover operation in Vietnam Customs launched its investigation of Standard Chartered Bank in 1991. </P> <P> According to a case summary written in June 1991 by John C. Kelley then head of Customs strategic investigations unit the bank and its foreign counterpart in Singapore were suspected of moving funds from U.S. sources to Vietnam. </P> <P> By the time Newcomb's agency was asked for help the probe had obtained documents that ``set forth operational procedures for covertly moving U.S. funds to Vietnam'' through wire transfers Kelley's memo said. </P> <P> Agents had identified specific accounts through which money was moving and had collected evidence indicating the alleged violators knew their actions were illegal and were ``specifically warned not to name beneficiary Vietnamese banks '' the summary said. </P> <P> Customs asked Newcomb's office simply to track the funds to verify they had moved to Vietnam and to determine their origin said several officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity. </P> <P> Newcomb's agents did the initial work requested by Customs. But when they returned in August 1991 with bank records corroborating that funds had moved to Vietnam Newcomb gave a series of orders that mystified his own agents. </P> <P> At that point Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Cleary in New York had asked Newcomb's agents to further investigate the total amount of transfers to Vietnam according to handwritten notes kept by Newcomb's assistant chief of enforcement Steve Plitman. </P> <P> ``Newcomb says no!'' Plitman's notes state. </P> <P> Plitman's notes say that Newcomb then instructed Plitman and fellow criminal investigator Bob Sheridan ``not to make further contact'' with Cleary and that Newcomb intended to handle the matter ``internally.'' </P> <P> ``Customs out of loop. Our violation '' the notes quote Newcomb as saying. </P> <P> Plitman and Sheridan declined to be interviewed. </P> <P> In the end the only action taken was the cease-and-desist order and a subsequent freezing of transactions that moved through some of the bank accounts. The mild punishment outraged Customs officials. </P>,Haiti,Singapore,0.400000006,-0.400000006,0.00066774,

APW_ENG_19941115.0468,2/7/2004, <P> Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Tuesday rejected U.S. allegations that he and his regime are living luxuriously while the nation bears the brunt of harsh U.N. sanctions. </P> <P> ``They are angry because we continue to rebuild under siege '' the Iraqi president told a Cabinet meeting according to a dispatch by the state-run Iraqi News Agency monitored in Cyprus. </P> <P> ``What exacerbates the U.S. administration's anger and feeling of frustration is the fact that the embargo not only failed to crush the Iraqis' willpower but it taught them to be more keen and precise in construction and inventiveness ...'' </P> <P> On Monday the United States presented the U.N. Security Council with a dozen satellite photographs showing construction work on government palaces in Iraq. </P> <P> A U.S. official at the United Nations speaking on condition of anonymity said Iraq has spent dlrs 1.2 billion on the project to build or expand 30 lavish residences. </P> <P> ``Living standards for most Iraqis have fallen but not for Saddam Hussein and his family '' said U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright. ``They continue to enjoy uninterrupted supply of ice cream cigarettes liquor and other imported luxuries.'' </P> <P> Albright's presentation was meant to add force to Washington's argument for a continuation of the oil and trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. </P> <P> After viewing the photos the council voted to maintain the sanctions which have crippled Iraq's economy and engendered widespread poverty. </P> <P> Iraq has lobbied hard for a lifting of the sanctions and last week sought to comply with one U.N. demand by recognizing Kuwait's sovereignty for the first time in history. </P> <P> But Saddam lost whatever support he had after massing tens of thousands of troops along the Kuwaiti border last month. Washington and its allies responded in kind to what was considered a menacing act. </P> <P> Before the sanctions can be lifted the Security Council must be satisfied Iraq has complied with the terms of the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire including U.N. weapons monitoring and return of Kuwaiti prisoners of war. </P> <P> The United States also insists that Baghdad halt the repression of its own people and take other measures to improve its human rights record. </P> <P> Saddam conceded some of the photos showed palaces including the presidential residence. But he maintained the edifice belongs to the public: ``It is a national symbol ... a peoples' palace.'' </P> <P> He added the structures are the last to be rebuilt after the Gulf War. </P> <P> ``The Iraqis built hundreds of bridges power plants oil refineries dams factories communications centers railways hospitals and depots.

The Ibope polling institute's exit polls showed President-elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso allies were ahead in four of Brazil's most populous states. Support from governors there is crucial to push through Congress the reforms needed to fight inflation stabilize the economy speed up privatization and reduce bloated government. In Brazil state governors hold strong sway over congressional delegations that make the nation's laws in the 513-member Chamber of Deputies and the 81-seat Senate. About 74 million voters were eligible to vote in 16 states and the federal district -- Brasilia the capital -- where no candidate won a majority in the Oct. 3 general election the largest in Brazil's history. -------- CARACAS Venezuela (AP) -- The Attorney General said Tuesday he will seek to have former President Carlos Andres Perez pay dlrs 3.5 million in damages if convicted on corruption charges. Ivan Dario Badell said Perez should pay the damages because his actions may have hurt the state's interests. Perez is under investigation by the Supreme Court for allegedly embezzling and misusing dlrs 17.2 million during his 1989-93 presidency. He was removed from office in May 1993 when the court opened the probe and jailed a year later when it decided there was enough evidence to continue with the investigation. On July 26 the court granted him house arrest because of his age 72. ``At this stage nothing can surprise me...in a case without a crime '' Perez told Union Radio. ``I'm at peace.'' Dario Badell formally charged Perez on Tuesday with embezzlement and misuse of funds and asked that he pay damages. The court is expected to rule on the case early next year. ------ TEGUCIGALPA Honduras (AP) -- Central American presidents preparing for a hemispheric summit say they will ask President Clinton to review an initiative approved by California voters that will deny public aid to illegal immigrants. ``Proposition 187 denies to undocumented immigrants the right to health and education ... and constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights '' said Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina. Reina said he and his counterparts from Guatemala El Salvador Nicaragua Costa Rica and Panama will make the request during the conference of leaders from the Western Hemisphere scheduled to be held Dec. 9-11 in Miami. As president Clinton can review the state initiative but he has no legal power to do anything about it. Proposition 187 approved by California voters last week would deny undocumented immigrants public services such as education welfare and non-emergency medical services. California is home to tens of thousands of Central American and Mexican immigrants. ------ SAN SALVADOR El Salvador (AP) -- Striking bus owners clashed with army troops in the eastern part of the country. At least two people were killed and 20 wounded. Police said the fighting started Monday afternoon in San Miguel province 135 kilometers (85 miles) east of San Salvador when riot squads backed by soldiers tried to clear roadblocks around the provincial capital of the same name. Jenny Orellana a Red Cross official in San Miguel said in a telephone interview the number of dead and wounded may be more. ``We don't know yet if the dead are civilians or military. The only thing we know is that three soldiers wounded are from the 3rd Infantry Brigade '' she said. She said the three soldiers were the only wounded that Red Cross workers could evacuate from the scene of the fighting and skirmishes were still going on at nightfall. ``We are trying to control the situation but the fighting continues '' said a police source in San Miguel speaking on condition of anonymity. Line owners blocked access roads to the provincial capital with at least 150 buses at dawn protesting because the Transportation Ministry had issued permits to minibuses to operate the same routes. ------ TEGUCIGALPA Honduras (AP) -- Postal authorities in this Central American nation are desperately trying to deliver some 11 million letters and packages that have piled up during a strike by mail workers. ``It is intense work but with the people we have we are trying to serve the citizens '' Postal Director General Ercilia Thompson said Tuesday. Some 1 800 mail workers -- about 30 percent of the work force -- went on strike Thursday after soldiers and police officers violently dislodged postal employees who had occupied their offices for a week. They were demanding a 50 percent salary increase. Honduran postal workers earn about dlrs 150 a month. Thompson said employees who do not return to work within three days will be fired. Postal Workers Union President David Flores said the workers intend to continue their strike despite Thompson's threat. Soldiers and police officers on Tuesday continued to guard post offices to prevent a possible reoccupation by workers. ------ TEGUCIGALPA Honduras (AP) -- Leaders of popular organizations called on Roman Catholic churches Tuesday to provide asylum to young men who want to avoid the military draft. The call by the Christian Civic Movement a coalition of some 50 popular groups is part of a campaign to force President Roberto Reina to abolish conscription and head off a huge military draft planned for next week. ``All of the Catholic churches in national territory have been asked to give refuge to all young men who eventually will be persecuted by the army '' said Alba Mejia the movement's coordinator. ``This decision has been adopted by the popular organizations because the armed forces do not guarantee the lives of the boys they are generally tortured and submitted to all kinds of abuses in the barracks.'' There was no immediate response to the call from church or military leaders. Every year the army recruits -- often by force -- more than 7 000 men between the ages of 18 and 30 to serve two years military service. The legislature in May modified the law to allow young men to opt to provide social work rather than military service. But that law doesn't go into effect until next year. ,Nicaragua,Panama; Brazil; Guatemala; Honduras,0.001201825, , , 
APW_ENG_19941115.0496,12/13/2005, <P> TRW Inc. and Montreal-based Teleglobe Inc. are forming a dlrs 2 billion venture to create a personal communications satellite system although the field is crowded and at least one major project is well ahead. </P> <P> The Odyssey system of 12 satellites which could be operational by 1999 would provide voice fax and paging services to subscribers worldwide said Joseph T. Gorman TRW's chairman and chief executive officer. </P> <P> TRW and Montreal-based Teleglobe will hold a 15 percent equity interest in the Odyssey system and seek financing for the remaining 85 percent. The companies said the majority of the financing is expected to be in equity and the balance a combination of debt and vendor financing. </P> <P> Earth stations for Odyssey will cost about dlrs 500 million. </P> <P> TRW's businesses include auto parts aerospace and defense and information systems. Teleglobe is Canada's international telecommunications carrier. </P> <P> A competitor however is already ahead with a similar project. </P> <P> Washington-based Iridium Corp. plans to have a dlrs 3.5 billion network of 66 satellites in low-Earth orbit by 1998. </P> <P> Spokesman John Windolph said Tuesday that Iridium composed of Motorola Inc. and 16 other telecommunications companies worldwide reached its goal of dlrs 1.6 billion in equity financing in September. </P> <P> ``We welcome the competition but they have a long way to go '' Windolph said. ``TRW has a long way to go just to achieve financing to proceed with their program.'' </P> <P> The Iridium satellites will be launched in Russia China and in the United States in California Windolph said. He said the planned orbits will be considerably lower than the orbits of the Odyssey satellites allowing for better service. </P> <P> TRW has applied to the Federal Communications Commission to operate the Odyssey system through its Space and Electronics Group based in Redondo Beach Calif. </P> <P> A TRW source said the FCC is expected to only grant five such licenses and the potential field may exceed that number. Other similar projects are Globalstar a project of Loral Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. and an international group known as InMarSat. </P> <P> Tim Hannemann executive vice president of the TRW Space and Electronics Group said the Odyssey satellites will go up two at a time but the launch means and locations have not been finalized. </P> <P> The system of satellites at about 6 000 miles (10 000 kilometers) above Earth would be designed to improve on the quality and speed of service now available. </P> <P> Hannemann said the higher Odyssey orbit known as a medium Earth orbit will help reduce operating costs while maintaining good service quality. </P> <P> ``The quality will be very competitive '' Hannemann said. ``It will be better in fact than Iridium and better than the current cellular quality. There will be less chance of obstruction of the signal.'' </P> <P> Odyssey expects to charge less than dlrs 1 a minute for calls compared to up to dlrs 3 a minute projected for some other systems in development according to TRW officials. </P>,Canada,China,0.001821071, , , 
APW_ENG_19941115.0504,4/18/2006, <P> NATO's warships will continue to enforce the international arms embargo imposed on former Yugoslavia despite the U.S. decision to no longer stop ships carrying arms to Bosnia. </P> <P> The United States announced last week it would stop enforcing the embargo against the Muslim-led Bosnian government although its three ships will continue to block arms destined for Serbia and other former Yugoslav states. </P> <P> At a meeting Tuesday ambassadors from NATO's 16 member nations decided to uphold the arms embargo against all of former Yugoslavia despite the U.S. move. </P> <P> The U.S. decision upset other NATO nations and may deepen differences among the allies over how to end the Bosnian war. </P> <P> But Tuesday NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes played down any differences among the allies. </P> <P> ``There is no question of speaking about a division '' he said at alliance headquarters. ``This morning we spoke as 16. Tomorrow we will speak again as 16.'' </P> <P> In Washington Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the NATO alliance would survive the rift over the embargo enforcement. </P> <P> ``This is a difficult issue for NATO. We don't back away from that '' Bacon said. But he added ``The alliance has lasted a long time it's a strong vibrant and resilient alliance.'' </P> <P> Claes will fly to the United States on Wednesday for meetings with President Clinton and other administration officials. While his trip had been scheduled earlier the focus has shifted because of the U.S. decision. </P> <P> The embargo was imposed in 1991 against all parties in the conflict as Yugoslavia disintegrated and fighting began in Slovenia and Croatia. </P> <P> A total of 19 ships patrol the Adriatic Sea as part of the NATO task force. </P> <P> Bacon emphasized that the U.S. Navy's role was relatively small and said ending its participation would not affect the ability of the European allies to patrol the Adriatic. He declined to answer a question on whether the United States is supplying military intelligence to the Bosnian government forces. </P> <P> Washington hopes its policy shift on enforcement will push Bosnian Serbs into accepting an international peace plan for Bosnia. It argues the embargo has placed the Muslims at a disadvantage against the better-armed Serbs. </P> <P> But Bacon said there is no movement in that direction. </P> <P> ``We regret that the fighting has continued '' Bacon said. ``We think that everybody ought to see that the best way to end the fighting is clear and that is to accept the peace plan.'' </P>,Slovenia,Serbia; Croatia,0.400000006,-0.400000006,0.00064019,

APW_ENG_19941115.0522,1/16/2006, <P> When Karachi's top official gets to the office his sleeves are rolled up his phones are ringing furiously and dozens of men are waiting in the sweltering hall to ask urgent favors. </P> <P> There are no easy days for Faheem Khan as he tries to save one of the world's most troubled cities. </P> <P> ``I'm surprised myself sometimes how the city carries on with all its problems '' Khan said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``We have unemployment crime and pollution. People are chasing each other through the streets with guns every day but the city survives.'' </P> <P> Just barely many people say. The congested steamy port with 10 million residents has lurched from crisis to crisis in recent years and now a surge in political ethnic and religious violence is threatening to get out of control. </P> <P> Karachi's woes have scared away foreign investors at a time when international money is pouring into Asia and fueling booms in much of the region. Karachi like the rest of Pakistan has seen little economic growth. </P> <P> There are gunbattles in the streets almost daily. The most serious conflict pits security forces against the Mohajir Qaumi Movement a minority group that uses violence strikes and other confrontational tactics to repeatedly paralyze Karachi Pakistan's business capital and biggest city. </P> <P> In just one 24-hour period recently the ambush slaying of an opposition politician and three relatives triggered a spree of sniper attacks across Karachi that killed 13 more people and wounded about 50. The killings raised the city's death toll from shootings to more than 150 in five weeks. </P> <P> The violence has added to the general turmoil of a city suffering from frequent power blackouts high unemployment and dawn-to-dusk traffic jams. </P> <P> Khan 33 was flying a helicopter for an air ambulance service until June when Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto picked him as city administrator the top government post. </P> <P> She had wanted Abdul Sattar Edhi who heads Pakistan's only privately run emergency service and is often compared to India's Mother Teresa because of his charity work. Edhi declined and suggested Khan -- ``one of my most trusted people.'' </P> <P> Khan has no government experience. But some say it is appropriate that a man versed in emergency rescues has been put in charge of Karachi. </P> <P> The army was called in two years ago to assist Karachi police in trying to curb violence that has killed an estimated 4 000 people since 1986. </P> <P> But the troops have not stopped the bloodshed or dampened the popularity of the Mohajir movement which represents Muslims who migrated to Pakistan from India when the subcontinent was divided into two nations in 1947. </P> <P> The Mohajirs account for a majority of Karachi's population but only about 10 percent of Pakistan's 120 million people and they feel shortchanged by fellow Muslims when it comes to jobs education and political clout. </P> <P> ``The government does not consider Mohajirs to be sons of the soil '' said M.A. Jalil one of the movement's leaders. ``They don't feel we have the same rights as others.'' </P> <P> Security officers repeatedly round up Mohajir activists and about 500 are now under some form of detention. The figure includes Jalil's wife Nasreen a senator in the National Assembly who is under house arrest. </P> <P> There are other feuds contributing to the city's disorder. The Mohajir movement is itself split into two factions whose members often battle each other. Also followers of the Shiite and Sunni Muslim sects ambush one another with regularity and criminal gangs battle for turf in a city where underpaid and poorly trained police have little authority. </P> <P> Ms. Bhutto who has a house in Karachi's well-to-do Clifton district expressed shock at conditions when she spent a week in the city in July. </P> <P> She chastised city officials and announced an aid package but the federal government in Islamabad is chronically broke and few believe any real help is coming. </P> <P> Karachi was a modest city of about 100 000 when Pakistan won independence from Britain 47 years ago. But a relentless inflow of unskilled migrants from the countryside increased the population a hundredfold overwhelming the city's ability to provide services. </P> <P> Several million residents live in squalid slums that sprouted throughout the city. Social order broke down over the last decade as a tidal wave of guns and drugs flowed into Karachi from the civil war in Afghanistan. </P> <P> The city is burdened by a bloated bureaucracy that many people view as incompetent and corrupt. Khan said he has been offered bribes as high as dlrs 300 000 (10 million rupees) for government contracts. </P> <P> He was shocked to discover that only 12 of the city's 54 firetrucks were in working order when he took office. He was dumbfounded when he learned the city was still paying for 800 full-time firemen -- and many were getting overtime. </P> <P> ``This is how irrational our bureaucracy has become '' said Khan. </P> <P> ``I don't want to stay in this job even one day more than necessary '' he added. ``I just want to get back to flying my helicopter.'' </P>,Afghanistan,Pakistan; India,0.000670901, , , 
APW_ENG_19941115.0531,9/23/2004, <P> Pointing to the choppy Mediterranean Sea Yasser Arafat complained that little headway has been made to ease the crushing poverty in the Gaza Strip despite more than six months of autonomy. </P> <P> ``The Israelis sometimes even prevent the fishermen from going to sea to fish '' Arafat said Tuesday in an interview with The Associated Press on Palestinian Independence Day. </P> <P> Despite rhetoric about creating a Palestinian state the reality is that Arafat's power is severely limited -- both by Israeli restrictions and by a lack of funds -- and real independence seems a distant dream. </P> <P> The dimensions of the crisis facing Arafat can be seen everywhere. </P> <P> Lakes of rainwater flood streets where children play mixing with sewage that flows openly. More than 40 cases of cholera have been reported and farmers are suffering because the cholera scare has prompted Israel to ban the import of tomatoes grown with untreated water. </P> <P> The dock being built with Dutch money down the beach from Arafat's headquarters is still unfinished even though Arafat vowed it would be complete by August. </P> <P> Youths hang about in the streets banned by Israel from jobs in its territory at a time when Arafat contends unemployment has reached 58 percent. </P> <P> Even Arafat's ability to persuade the public is limited. The Palestinian Broadcast Corp. located next to Arafat's office is in a state of suspension ill-equipped its walls unfinished. TV and radio broadcasts of music news and Arabic films cover only five hours a day and reach only a fraction of the 750 000 people in the Gaza Strip. </P> <P> If nothing is done about the poverty soon Arafat warned there would be an ``explosion of the peace process.'' </P> <P> Discontent is evident on the walls where slogans have reappeared for the first time since autonomy began in May -- this time aimed at Arafat as well as Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. </P> <P> ``We call on Arafat and the Palestinian authority to stop implementing the orders of Rabin and immediately release all Islamic Jihad prisoners '' said one slogan spray-painted in green by Islamic militants. </P> <P> Militants at a rally this week warned Arafat his fate could be the same as that of Anwar Sadat the Egyptian President assassinated by Islamic fundamentalists in 1981 after he made peace with Israel. </P> <P> ``Oh Arafat oh Arafat. Remember that Islamic Jihad killed Sadat '' they shouted. </P> <P> Under pressure from Israel Arafat has arrested about 180 Islamic militants in the wake of the latest attack Friday when a suicide bomber killed three Israeli soldiers and wounded six outside a Jewish settlement in Gaza. </P> <P> ``Some fanatic groups are using poverty'' as a cover for violence said Arafat dressed in his olive green military suit with a pistol strapped to his waist. </P> <P> ``We in the Palestinian authority are using all our efforts to cool things down and using our credibility. But for how long?'' </P> <P> Arafat blamed Israel for spurring the cycle of violence. </P> <P> He said the suicide bomb attack on soldiers was in response to the Nov. 2 car bomb assassination of an Islamic fundamentalist leader Hani Abed whose death is widely blamed on Israel. </P> <P> ``Violence has two sides and the target is the peace of the brave '' said Arafat. </P> <P> Arafat traces most of his problems to a lack of money. </P> <P> International donors have provided only dlrs 40 million of the dlrs 690 million promised for this year. ``Six percent six percent '' Arafat complained. </P> <P> ``Its an international responsibility a moral political and humanitarian responsibility '' said Arafat suggesting that the U.S. administration was behind the delay. </P> <P> He recalled telling President Clinton at the Sept. 13 1993 signing of the PLO-Israel accord that ``either we will have a new Somalia in the Middle East or another Singapore.'' </P> <P> International donors however fear the Palestine Liberation Organization's track record of corruption and mismanagement and are demanding tough accounting procedures before handing over money. </P> <P> Israeli restrictions also cut into Arafat's credibility. </P> <P> For example Israel has occasionally grounded fishing boats as part of its periodic tightening and loosening of the closure of the Gaza Strip in the wake of attacks. The current closure was imposed after the Oct. 19 Tel Aviv bus bombing by Islamic militants that claimed 22 lives. </P> <P> Israel has also objected to some foreign visitors invited by Arafat to come to his spare whitewashed office in a former police station known as al-Muntada ``the club'' in Arabic. </P> <P> First it was Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in September and this week Austrian President Thomas Klestil who was urged by Israel not to go to Gaza. </P> <P> ``I hope that they are no against my getting the Nobel Prize '' said Arafat with a sardonic grin referring to the ceremony in December when he is to share the peace prize with Rabin and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. </P>,Singapore,Somalia; Israel,0.000485542, , ,

APW_ENG_19941115.0555,11/1/2006, <P> Early cheers at the prospect of liberalized trade across the Pacific -- the world's most dynamic economic region -- were followed quickly by some sober second thoughts. </P> <P> Leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum reached consensus on Tuesday that the developed economies among their 18 members should lift barriers to trade and investment by the year 2010 and the rest by 2020. </P> <P> Now comes the task of trying to figure out how to apply it to such a populous and diverse region. </P> <P> First they may have to redefine consensus a near sacred tenet of APEC decision-making to something closer to a majority vote. </P> <P> Indonesia's President Suharto termed it a ``flexible consensus '' according to Australian President Paul Keating meaning that one dissenter would not be able to block action by the others. </P> <P> APEC's decision-making machinery will become ever more complex as the implications of Tuesday's resolution sink in and member-nations begin to have second -- and third -- thoughts. </P> <P> By his own admission the dissenter was Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad again in the role of odd-man-out. Mahathir boycotted last year's summit in Seattle in part because he is wary of APEC becoming too institutionalized. </P> <P> Mahathir went public with a list of ``reservations '' which he said were shared by other leaders whom he did not identify. </P> <P> In effect he said that Malaysia would follow its own path if it seemed that APEC was not delivering the goods. </P> <P> Chinese President Jiang Zemin was among those sounding a cautionary note. </P> <P> ``Liberalization should proceed from reality and should be implemented in a phased and gradual manner. There should be different timetables according to which some members should move earlier than others '' he told a news conference. </P> <P> Even the very upbeat Keating cautioned that ``many difficult issues will need to be negotiated.'' </P> <P> Not surprising considering they are trying to mesh the economies of Brunei and Chile and Papua New Guinea and the United States among others. </P> <P> Some second thoughts stem from the 11-point APEC Economic Leaders' Declaration of Common Resolve which appears to be both part of the problem and part of the solution. </P> <P> It is broad enough to accommodate everyone now because it is all things to all people. Cabinet ministers and other underlings have been told to produce the nuts and bolts ``soon'' to make it function. </P> <P> Among many other things they will have to deal with the fact that most Asian economies have substantially higher tariff barriers than those of the Western members of APEC. </P> <P> Sir Hamish Macleod Hong Kong's financial secretary acknowledged the declaration had loopholes and other shortcomings. ``It's not a crystal clear bit of drafting '' he said referring to one clause that seemed to cancel out another. </P> <P> The success of the free trade proposal is clearly linked to GATT and the World Trade Organization that is to succeed it next year. Any hitches in launching the WTO promise headaches for APEC. </P> <P> Any slump in the economies of a region that has been booming for years would also slow the move to free trade. </P> <P> ``This is a very delicate process that we're engaged in ... so let's wait and within a year I'm very hopeful that we will be able to define for you what it is we've created here. We have to fill in the gaps '' Macleod said. ------ </P> <P> EDITOR'S NOTE: Kenneth Whiting AP bureau chief in Singapore since 1974 often reports from Indonesia. </P>,Singapore,Guinea; Malaysia; Chile; Indonesia,0.001006819, , ,

There are a whole series of option you could thank of; an exclusion zone is one.'' </P> <P> Claes will fly to the United States on Wednesday for meetings with President Clinton and other administration officials. While his trip had been scheduled earlier the focus has shifted because of the U.S. decision. </P> <P> The embargo was imposed in 1991 against all parties in the conflict as Yugoslavia disintegrated and fighting began in Slovenia and Croatia. </P> <P> A total of 19 ships patrol the Adriatic Sea as part of the NATO task force. </P> <P> Bacon emphasized that the U.S. Navy's role was relatively small and said ending its participation would not affect the ability of the European allies to patrol the Adriatic. He declined to answer a question on whether the United States is supplying military intelligence to the Bosnian government forces. </P> <P> Washington hopes its policy shift on enforcement will push Bosnian Serbs into accepting an international peace plan for Bosnia. It argues the embargo has placed the Muslims at a disadvantage against the better-armed Serbs. </P> <P> But Bacon said there is no movement in that direction. </P> <P> ``We regret that the fighting has continued '' Bacon said. ``We think that everybody ought to see that the best way to end the fighting is clear and that is to accept the peace plan.'' </P>,Slovenia,Serbia; Croatia,0.400000006,-0.400000006,0.000541742, 
APW_ENG_19941116.0001,3/21/2004, <P> President Clinton on Wednesday met with Indonesian President Suharto and then challenged Republicans who will run Congress to follow the tradition of bipartisanship in foreign affairs. </P> <P> ``Partisanship stops at the water's edge '' Clinton said quoting a former Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman. </P> <P> Rejecting Republican efforts to delay a vote on a world trade agreement Clinton urged his newly strengthened opponents to join with Democrats and ratify the pact before a new Congress takes office in January. </P> <P> Clinton issued his plea in a speech prepared for delivery to business leaders following his talks with Suharto who has ruled this country with a firm hand for 27 years. </P> <P> Clinton had said he would raise allegations of human rights abuses with Suharto but their talks also focussed on economics and the new Asian pledge to break down trade barriers. </P> <P> The talks at Jakarta Palace wrapped up a three-day Clinton visit in Indonesia where leaders of 18 Asian and Pacific nations pledged ``free and open trade'' in the economically booming region by the year 2020. </P> <P> In his prepared speech Clinton urged Congress to approve a sweeping world-trade agreement when it returns in a lame-duck session later this month. </P> <P> Clinton said the accord the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) would open trade markets and produce high-wage jobs that would help every American family. </P> <P> ``We've faced opposition to GATT from people in both parties but we've also had strong bipartisan support '' the president said. </P> <P> ``I invite the new Republican leaders of Congress to ratify (the late) Sen. (Arthur) Vandenburg's admonition that `partisanship stops at the water's edge' and join me in doing what's right for the American people '' Clinton said. </P> <P> The underlying message from Vandenberg was that Democrats and Republicans can squabble over domestic policy but should stand united when it comes to foreign affairs. </P> <P> Just hours before Clinton spoke Sen. Jesse Helms R-S.C. the incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee hinted he would hinder Clinton's foreign policy initiatives unless the president agreed to postpone the GATT vote under early next year when Republicans take over. </P> <P> White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers said the administration still wants GATT passed this year. </P> <P> Earlier Clinton said that Tuesday's meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum produced a ``very historic declaration'' that would result in more U.S. high-wage jobs and sales overseas. </P> <P> ``What we are doing in this agreement is opening the fastest-growing market in the world '' Clinton said. </P> <P> A red-uniformed military band played the national anthems of both countries as Clinton was welcomed in sultry weather to Suharto's gleaming white palace. </P> <P> The president said Tuesday the United States must champion human rights ``with both patience and determination and we will.'' </P> <P> Suharto at a news conference Tuesday refused to answer a question about his human rights record. Human rights groups have accused Suharto's authoritarian government of violently suppressing dissidents and other abuses. </P> <P> With Clinton in town students continued a sit-in on the parking lot of the U.S. Embassy in protest against Indonesian rule of East Timor. There also was a rowdy demonstration on the campus of East Timor University in Dili the provincial capital of East Timor. </P> <P> Clinton spent Tuesday in summit talks at the presidential palace at Bogor surrounded by lush gardens and ponds filled with huge lily pads. Later he held a news conference at a Jakarta hotel. </P> <P> After campaigning on a domestic agenda and accusing President Bush of paying too much attention to foreign policy Clinton stoutly defended his frequent travels overseas. </P> <P> Foreign policy ventures have traditionally been a welcome diversion for politically battered presidents. Clinton however said his focus overseas was the result of progress in Middle East peace talks vital U.S. interests in Europe and his efforts to expand foreign trade. </P> <P> Clinton does not expect to reduce his foreign involvements. He announced he will go to Budapest for a European summit next month. He is also expected to visit Haiti and to host a Latin American summit in Miami. </P> <P> ``There have been more opportunities and more responsibilities in this particular year than even I could have foreseen when I ran for president '' Clinton said. </P> <P> A president ``has a special responsibility'' to make sure Americans do well in the global arena he said. Nevertheless Clinton said ``I expect that the lion's share of my work will continue to be done at home ... We'll have to do both from now on.'' </P> <P> Even before Republicans captured control of Congress Clinton watched in frustration as lawmakers blocked his efforts to win reforms in health insurance lobbying laws and campaign financing. </P>,Haiti,Indonesia,0.001021557, , ,

Some Republican congressmen also advocate normalized relations he said. </P> <P> Kerry and six other U.S. senators on a separate visit met Wednesday with members of the Hanoi chapter of the unofficial American Chamber of Commerce of Vietnam. </P> <P> ``A stronger relationship with Vietnam is not merely a matter of business '' Kerry said. ``Vietnam can be and I predict will be a very important player and even an ally in the issue of maintaining stability in this region.'' </P> <P> Hanoi could serve American interests by helping the government of neighboring Cambodia overcome the threat from extremist Khmer Rouge guerrillas he said. Vietnam could help integrate isolationist Burma into the regional economy and also play a role in U.S. relations with China Kerry added. </P> <P> Fellow Democrat Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia echoed Kerry's assessment of Vietnam's overall cooperation on MIAs but expressed a more cautious approach to normalization. </P> <P> ``We've taken one step '' he told reporters referring to the two countries' agreement in May to open liaison offices in each other's capitals. ``I think we ought to decide how this does for a while then decide where to go from here.'' </P> <P> Kerry said he had extensive talks about human rights Tuesday with Do Muoi Vietnam's Communist Party leader raising specific cases of jailed dissidents. </P> <P> Human rights conditions are improving gradually he said and he advocated greater involvement by Western countries to help the process along.

The students are protesting Indonesian occupation of the former Portuguese colony of East Timor. </P> <P> What was Suharto's response? ``He stated he believes the Indonesian government is dealing with the issue squarely '' said a senior administration official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. </P> <P> Some critics have accused Clinton of ignoring human rights for the sake of increased trade. </P> <P> Clinton was headed next to Hawaii for several days of rest before returning to deal with tough political challenges at home. </P> <P> As he prepared to leave Asia Clinton reached out to Republicans -- urging them to support both his market-opening moves with Asia and more immediately a new set of global trade-liberalization rules up for a vote next month in Congress. </P> <P> ``Only a few decisions by Congress have had the same capacity to show what we stand for and show where we are heading '' Clinton told the business group. </P> <P> Some Republicans have urged that the vote on tariff-lowering General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) legislation be postponed until next year when they will gain control of both chambers. </P> <P> Meanwhile Clinton applauded contracts signed this week between U.S. businesses and Asian concerns -- including contracts signed today in Indonesia worth over dlrs 40 billion timed to coincide with the president's visit. </P> <P> These ranged from an Exxon contract with the country's national oil company to develop an off-shore natural gas field to joint ventures in telecommunications power transmission and environmental cleanup. </P> <P> ``We're grateful for the business '' Clinton said. ``The most important thing for me is these contracts will support jobs thousands of them back home.'' </P> <P> Human rights was a key item on the agenda as Clinton met with Suharto in the opulent Jakarta Palace also the site for a state dinner that Clinton was attending tonight. </P> <P> In an airy meeting room with elaborate chandeliers and decorated with huge tropical fish tanks in carved wooden cabinets Clinton ``raised the subject (of human rights) in firm and forceful terms '' Secretary of State Warren Christopher said. </P> <P> The secretary met separately with the government-appointed Indonesian Human Rights Commission to further press U.S. concerns about government steps against dissidents labor leaders and residents of East Timor. </P> <P> ``The relationship between the United States and Indonesia can never reach its highest levels unless the people of the United States have confidence that there is an effort here to respect the human rights of all the citizens '' Christopher said. </P> <P> Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a year later. </P> <P> Clinton's decision to focus on human rights issues appeared to be an effort to answer human rights activists who accuse him of ignoring such concerns here and in China for the sake of expanding trade and commerce in the fast-growing region. </P> <P> He later told the business group: ``Even as we nurture trade and investment with Asia we will continue to promote human rights with conviction and without apology. At a time when America is strong and we inspire others around the world we cannot we must not and we will not turn away from that cause.'' </P> <P> His meetings with Suharto wrapped up a three-day visit in Indonesia where leaders of 18 Asian and Pacific leaders pledged on Tuesday to achieve ``free and open trade'' in the economically booming region by the year 2020. </P> <P> Clinton earlier visited the Philippines. </P>,China,Philippines; Indonesia,0.300000012,-0.300000012,0.000424644,

Finantia offered 1 300 escudos per share. </P> <P> The sealed bids were opened at a public session at Lisbon Stock Exchange. The government had set a reserve share price of 1 050 escudos on the bank which was nationalized after Portugal's leftist 1974 revolution. </P> <P> Before the revolution Champalimaud owned the bank Portugal's sixth largest in terms of deposits and ranked seventh in assets. </P> <P> But market analysts said whoever bought the bank would end up paying considerably more to cover an undetermined amount of bad debt doubtful loans and extra provisions for a pension fund covering its older-than-average workforce. </P> <P> The government last year rejected a bid of less than 14 billion escudos for BPSM by Banco Comercial Portugues saying it was far too low. </P> <P> BCP one of the country's more dynamic banks said it could bid more without performing a proper audit focussing on bad debt and the pension fund. </P> <P> Champalimaud had apparently put in a ''safely high'' bid to ensure he won the bid in the first round market sources said. </P> <P> If the difference between the two bids Wednesday had been less than 5 percent the government had ruled both would have been given 20 minutes to revise their offers. </P> <P> The remaining 20 percent of the bank's shares are to be sold off at a later date to small investors and employees. </P> <P> The old money of a small group of powerful capitalists who held sway over the economy before the revolution is gradually filtering back into Portugal. It is pitted against new financial groups. </P> <P> Champalimaud fled to Brazil after the revolution and rebuilt his financial empire around the cement business.

APW_ENG_19941116.0101,4/17/2006, <P> The chairman of Suez Canal Authority said Wednesday that despite a decline in revenue in 1994 there will be no change in tolls for next year. </P> <P> The chairman Mohammed Ezzat Adel spoke with reporters on the eve of the 125th anniversary of the canal. The 195 kilometer (121 mile) canal was opened for international navigation on Nov. 17 1869. </P> <P> Adel disclosed that canal revenue would total about dlrs 1.87 billion this year down 4 percent from dlrs 1.95 billion in 1993. He said he expected income to return to the dlrs 1.95 billion level in 1995. </P> <P> Still he said ``the level of tolls in 1995 will be kept unchanged.'' </P> <P> He blamed this year's decline on sluggish economic performance in Europe and changes in international trade patterns including a reduction in the number of Japanese cars shipped to the West because of quotas and other restrictions. </P> <P> Adel acknowledged too that the canal faces rising competition from pipelines including a new gas line feeding Europe via Algeria. </P> <P> Canal officials ``are flexible to face up to the changes'' in the market he added. </P> <P> Adel said that to be more competitive the canal was offering discounts of up to 35 percent for tankers carrying liquefied natural gas from the Persian Gulf. </P> <P> He said that a tanker carrying gas from the United Arab Emirates to Europe had gotten a discount this month. </P> <P> The canal which had been limited to ships with a maximum draught of 53 feet has been widened and now can accommodate a draught of up to 56 feet. </P> <P> The next phase of the project will widen and deepen the channel so that by October 1996 ships of up to 59 feet in draught can use it. </P> <P> The Suez Canal which is owned by the government is one of Egypt's largest earners of foreign currency along with tourism and money sent home by nationals working abroad. </P> <P> Adel said that there are no plans to privatize the canal although the government may sell some of its affiliates such as shipyards and ship servicing companies. </P>,Egypt,Algeria,0.300000012,0.300000012,0.001799414, 
APW_ENG_19941116.0106,1/22/2005, <P> The European Union's economics chief said Wednesday that the rise in U.S. short-term interest rates will not damage Europe's economic recovery. </P> <P> ``The recovery in the European Union will go on. It will not be affected by what happened in the United States '' said Economics Commission Henning Christophersen. </P> <P> He said the U.S. Federal Reserve's move Tuesday to raise short-term interest rates by 0.75 percent will have less impact on Europe than future directions in Washington's fiscal policy. </P> <P> ``The decision has short-term implications only '' he said. ``More important is what happens in U.S. fiscal policy.'' </P> <P> The 1995-1996 U.S. budget deficit will rise unless Washington takes further steps to narrow it Christophersen predicted. </P> <P> Interest rates in some European countries may still have room to fall despite the U.S. tightening Christophersen said. </P> <P> ``I don't think you can exclude that'' he said. </P> <P> Economies in EU member states are not all at the same level he added. ``Some have high growth but others could have more room for manoeuver.'' </P> <P> Christophersen also said there are no signs of inflationary pressures in Europe's largest economies. </P> <P> Most EU economies including France and Germany are still in the early stages of recovery when inflation is unlikely to appear. Even in Britain where the recovery is most advanced Christophersen said there is no evidence of real inflation. </P> <P> ``We do not see real inflationary pressures for the time being '' he said. </P> <P> Christophersen said he wasn't surprised by the U.S. discount rate rise to 4.75 percent. </P> <P> Despite the rise Christophersen said EU governments do not have to tie their interest rates to those set by Washington. </P> <P> ``There can't be a complete separation but that (decoupling) is possible if we behave in an orderly way '' he said. </P> <P> ``Governments in member states should send clear signals to the financial markets to improve fiscal policy '' he added. </P> <P> Christophersen declined to comment on whether the EU should help prop up the dollar which strengthened on the news of the U.S. interest rate hike. </P> <P> But he added ``The position of the dollar is important for us.

APW_ENG_19941116.0111,10/16/2006, <P> The European Union's economics chief said Wednesday that the rise in U.S. short-term interest rates will not damage Europe's economic recovery. </P> <P> ``The recovery in the European Union will go on. It will not be affected by what happened in the United States '' said Economics Commission Henning Christophersen. </P> <P> He said the U.S. Federal Reserve's move Tuesday to raise short-term interest rates by 0.75 percent will have less impact on Europe than future directions in Washington's fiscal policy. </P> <P> ``The decision has short-term implications only '' he said. ``More important is what happens in U.S. fiscal policy.'' </P> <P> The 1995-1996 U.S. budget deficit will rise unless Washington takes further steps to narrow it Christophersen predicted. </P> <P> Interest rates in some European countries may still have room to fall despite the U.S. tightening Christophersen said. </P> <P> ``I don't think you can exclude that'' he said. </P> <P> Economies in EU member states are not all at the same level he added. ``Some have high growth but others could have more room for manoeuver.'' </P> <P> The U.S. move brought its discount rate to 4.75 percent from 4 percent. In comparison Germany's discount rate as set by its Bundesbank is 4.5 percent. </P> <P> The discount rate is the rate at which the fed or central bank makes emergency loans to commercial banks. </P> <P> Christophersen also said there are no signs of inflationary pressures in Europe's largest economies. </P> <P> Most EU economies including France and Germany are still in the early stages of recovery when inflation is unlikely to appear. Even in Britain where the recovery is most advanced Christophersen said there is no evidence of real inflation. </P> <P> ``We do not see real inflationary pressures for the time being '' he said. </P> <P> Despite the U.S rate hikes Christophersen said EU governments do not have to tie their interest rates to those set by Washington. </P> <P> ``There can't be a complete separation but that (decoupling) is possible if we behave in an orderly way '' he said. </P> <P> ``Governments in member states should send clear signals to the financial markets to improve fiscal policy '' he added. </P> <P> Christophersen declined to comment on whether the EU should help prop up the dollar which strengthened on the news of the U.S. interest rate hike. </P> <P> But he added ``The position of the dollar is important for us. It has a direct and immediate impact on our competitiveness.'' </P> <P> In June the EU's executive commission projected 1.6 percent growth in the trade bloc's gross domestic product in 1994 and 2.5 percent in 1995 compared to a contraction of 0.5 percent in 1993. </P> <P> The commission projected average EU inflation would slip to 3.3 percent this year and 2.9 percent in 1995 down from 3.9 percent last year. </P>,France,Germany,0.00089899, , ,

APW_ENG_19941116.0180,4/16/2006, <P> President Hosni Mubarak predicted Wednesday that Gaza and the West Bank could turn into ``a new tougher Afghanistan'' unless international aid quickly reaches the autonomous Palestinian territories. </P> <P> In an interview with The Associated Press and Associated Press Television Mubarak also said the violence would spread to Europe if the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank ``don't start feeling the results of peace.'' </P> <P> Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told The AP on Tuesday that only a trickle -- about 6 percent -- of the dlrs 690 million promised by donors for the year starting in May had been received so far. </P> <P> Mubarak said the dlrs 2.2 billion in aid pledged overall to the Palestinians is ``nonsense when you compare it with the money spent'' in the Middle East in nearly 50 years of warfare. </P> <P> In other comments Mubarak said it is not yet time to lift U.N. sanctions on Iraq and said that most Arab leaders do not trust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. </P> <P> He expressed hope that peace between Israel and Syria will be reached by June of next year and said so-called Islamic fundamentalists ``have no idea about'' Islam and use it as an excuse for common crime. </P> <P> Mubarak said delays in aid to Palestinians made the West Bank and Gaza ``fertile ground for Hamas and the Jihad '' two of the main Islamic radical groups. </P> <P> Speaking in an ornate reception room of Ittihadiya Palace Mubarak blamed bureaucracy by Western donor nations for the delay in aid to the Palestinians. </P> <P> He said that if lack of aid prevents development in the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip and West Bank ``it will be a failure to the whole (peace) process in the Middle East.'' </P> <P> ``Terrorism will be violent. It will be tough. Palestine will be a new tougher Afghanistan '' he said. ``The whole area including the Europeans the Arabs everyone will be affected.'' </P> <P> Mubarak said that President Hafez Assad of Syria ``wants to conclude a peace agreement'' but that Assad must lay the groundwork for peace since ``even in Syria public opinion counts.'' </P> <P> ``I hope something could be concluded before June next year '' he said ``before the campaigns for the elections in Israel and the United States.'' </P> <P> ``I think they will '' he added. </P> <P> In discussing Iraq Mubarak said the Iraqi people were the main victims of economic sanctions and said ``we have to find a way or a formula to help the people. ... They are suffering they are crying. We should find relief for them.'' </P> <P> But he added the time was not right for lifting the sanctions until Iraq implements all U.N. Security Council demands that grew out of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. </P> <P> ``Just promises or signatures or papers are not sufficient '' he said referring to Iraq's statement last week recognizing the borders of Kuwait. </P> <P> ``The Gulf countries and other Arabs don't trust Saddam. They will never believe him '' he said. He added however that most Arab nations did not want to see Iraq fall apart because that would leave Iran as the main power in the Gulf. </P> <P> He stopped short of calling for Saddam's overthrow saying that was a decision for the Iraqi people. </P> <P> ``It is the will of the people '' he said. ``If the will of the people is that Saddam will stay and (they) keep suffering it's their way.'' </P> <P> Mubarak said Egyptian fundamentalists are being funded from abroad. He said rich Iranian businessmen were among those supplying money. He also said funds for Islamic causes are being collected in mosques in the United States but that there is no proof the money is used for terrorism. </P> <P> He said terrorists use Islam as ``an excuse'' because ``it is a very good source to collect money.'' </P> <P> He said ``those who are committing crimes have no idea about Islam. ... Some of them have never prayed.'' He said Islam does not call for violence but ``like any other religion'' it encourages cooperation and love. </P> <P> Speaking of Egypt's economy Mubarak said the government was moving forward with a plan to sell off its vast business empire but has to move cautiously. </P> <P> ``We cannot do like the former Soviet Union did. ... It would be a collapse '' he said. </P> <P> He also resisted pressure by the International Monetary Fund for devaluation of the Egyptian pound. He said the pound's value -- about 3.37 to the U.S. dollar -- is based on market value. </P> <P> ``Don't ask me to devalue by 30 per cent. ...

APW_ENG_19941116.0200,4/26/2006, <P> President Hosni Mubarak predicted Wednesday that Gaza and the West Bank could turn into ``a new tougher Afghanistan'' unless international aid quickly reaches the autonomous Palestinian territories. </P> <P> In an interview with The Associated Press and Associated Press Television Mubarak also said the violence could spread to Europe if the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank ``don't start feeling the results of peace.'' </P> <P> Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told The AP on Tuesday that only about 6 percent of the dlrs 690 million promised by donors for the year starting in May had been received. </P> <P> Mubarak said the dlrs 2.2 billion in aid pledged overall to the Palestinians is ``nonsense when you compare it with the money spent'' in the Middle East in nearly 50 years of warfare. </P> <P> In other comments Mubarak said it is not yet time to lift U.N. sanctions on Iraq and that most Arab leaders do not trust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. </P> <P> He expressed hope that peace between Israel and Syria will be reached by June and said so-called Islamic fundamentalists ``have no idea about'' Islam and use it as an excuse for common crime. </P> <P> Mubarak said delays in aid to Palestinians made the West Bank and Gaza ``fertile ground for Hamas and the Jihad '' two of the main Islamic radical groups. </P> <P> Speaking in an ornate reception room of Ittihadiya Palace Mubarak blamed bureaucracy by Western donor nations for the delay in aid to the Palestinians. </P> <P> He said that if lack of aid prevents development in the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip and West Bank ``it will be a failure to the whole (peace) process in the Middle East.'' </P> <P> ``Terrorism will be violent. It will be tough. Palestine will be a new tougher Afghanistan '' he said. ``The whole area including the Europeans the Arabs everyone will be affected.'' </P> <P> Mubarak said President Hafez Assad of Syria ``wants to conclude a peace agreement'' but that Assad must lay the groundwork for peace since ``even in Syria public opinion counts.'' </P> <P> ``I hope something could be concluded before June next year '' he said ``before the campaigns for the elections in Israel and the United States.'' </P> <P> In discussing Iraq Mubarak said the Iraqi people were the main victims of economic sanctions: ``We have to find a way or a formula to help the people. ... They are suffering they are crying.'' </P> <P> But he added the time was not right for lifting the sanctions until Iraq implements all U.N. Security Council demands that grew out of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. </P> <P> ``Just promises or signatures or papers are not sufficient '' he said referring to Iraq's statement last week recognizing the borders of Kuwait. </P> <P> ``The Gulf countries and other Arabs don't trust Saddam. They will never believe him '' he said. He added however that most Arab nations did not want to see Iraq fall apart because that would leave Iran as the main power in the Gulf. </P> <P> He stopped short of calling for Saddam's overthrow saying that was a decision for the Iraqi people. </P> <P> ``It is the will of the people '' he said. ``If the will of the people is that Saddam will stay and (they) keep suffering it's their way.'' </P> <P> Mubarak said Egyptian fundamentalists are being funded from abroad. He said Iranian businessmen were among those supplying money. He also said funds for Islamic causes are being collected in mosques in the United States but that there is no proof the money is used for terrorism. </P> <P> He said terrorists use Islam as ``an excuse'' because ``it is a very good source to collect money.'' </P> <P> He said ``those who are committing crimes have no idea about Islam. ... Some of them have never prayed.'' </P> <P> Mubarak also said his government was moving cautiously forward with a plan to sell off its vast business empire. </P> <P> ``We cannot do like the former Soviet Union did. ... It would be a collapse '' he said. </P>,Afghanistan,Iraq; Israel; Kuwait,0.01368533, , ,

In another Group 7 match earlier Wednesday Georgia crushed Wales 5-0. </P> <P> Of the 11 Albanian starters none plays at home. They are scattered over a half-dozen countries from Scotland to Saudi Arabia. </P> <P> The Germans had won seven of the eight previous matches against Albania but the only draw 0-0 in 1967 eliminated Germany from the following year's European Championship finals the only time Germany failed to qualify for a major tournament. </P> <P> Trying to erase the memory of losing the World Cup title with a quarterfinal loss to Bulgaria this summer Germany began the match strongly although it was missing midfielder Thomas Haessler. </P> <P> Haessler is still recovering from recent tooth surgery and was replaced by Dieter Eilts. </P> <P> Klinsmann shot the Germans ahead after a brilliant move by the former world champions. Matthias Sammer fed Stefan Reuter on the right and the fast midfielder sped down the wing sending a sharp cross from the run. </P> <P> The ball found Klinsmann at the far post about 8 meters (yards) out. The Tottenham striker headed the ball into the opposite corner for the 1-0 lead. </P> <P> The Germans allowed the Albanians to recover from the shock and the home team began to threaten the German goal. </P> <P> The equalizer came form a free kick after Juergen Kohler had fouled Arthur Lekbello just outside the area. </P> <P> Zmijani who plays in Saudi Arabia curled the free kick through the badly-placed German wall with the ball passing by Thomas Berthold and finding the low left corner. </P> <P> Germany came out after the interval with Thomas Strunz for Sammer. </P> <P> Just 25 seconds into the second half the Germans were back in the lead. Ulf Kirsten pounced on a loose ball in the area after the Albanians failed to clear and beat goalkeeper Foto Strakosha with a low shot. </P> <P> Germany then controlled the pace keeping possession and allowing little room for Albanian forwards. </P> <P> The best opportunity for the Germans came late in the game after a controversial decision by Ukrainian referee Vasily Melnichuk who ruled an Albanian clearing attempt as a backpass to goalkeeper and awarded an indirect free kick to the Germans from some seven meters (yards). </P> <P> The ball was rolled to German captain Lothar Matthaeus playing his 120th international but Strakosha got his hand on the shot and the ball bounced off the post. </P> <P> In the dying seconds Ledio Pano hit the post with another free kick. </P> <P> A sell-out crowd of 23 000 watched the game on a sunny afternoon in the Quemal Stafa stadium while scores of fans scaled the outside walls to see the game. </P> <P> Albania: Foto Strakosha; Rudi Vata Arthur Lekbello Arjan Xhumba Hysen Zmijani (Ledio Pano 65) Salvador Kacaj Arjan Bellai Sokol Kushta Lefter Millo Altin Rraklli Sulejman Demollari (Bledar Kola 55). </P> <P> Germany: Andreas Koepke; Lothar Matthaeus Juergen Kohler Thomas Berthold Stefan Reuter Dieter Eilts Matthias Sammer (Thomas Strunz 46) Ralf Weber (Dirk Schuster 83) Andreas Moeller Ulf Kirsten Juergen Klinsmann. </P>,Georgia,Bulgaria; Germany; Albania,0.5,-0.5,0.006010311,

APW_ENG_19941116.0247,4/8/2005, <P> After a crash in Indiana that killed 68 people France on Wednesday urged air crews worldwide flying ATR-42 and 72 commuter planes not to fly on automatic pilot during ice build-up or severe turbulence. </P> <P> France's General Direction of Civil Aviation announced in a communique that its request ``was imperative while awaiting the results of the investigation'' into the accident. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued a similar warning a week ago. </P> <P> The ATR-72 owned by American Eagle crashed into a soybean field on its way to Chicago's O'Hare Airport while fighting gusts and rain. Everyone on board died. Initial evidence suggests that ice built up on the plane's wings destabilizing it. </P> <P> The French authorities said that the automatic pilot should immediately be turned off when ``lateral unbalance of the flight controls are observed'' or during ``abnormal behavior.'' It can be turned on again once the aircraft's steadies out manually. </P> <P> The 62 companies worldwide flying the aircraft were urged to put the warnings to be distributed by ATR in about two weeks in their flight manuals. </P> <P> There are 269 ATR-42s in service and 129 larger ATR-72s. Both are light twin-turboprops built by Avions de Transport Regional a consortium of French and Italian aircraft manufacturers. </P> <P> ATR canceled a ceremony Wednesday at its headquarters in Toulouse to deliver a previously ordered plane to American Eagle saying in a communique it was ``taking the circumstances into account.'' </P> <P> The aviation authorities meanwhile reported that investigation into the near-crash of an Airbus A310 belonging to Romania's Tarom airlines with 182 people aboard during a landing approach at Orly airport in Paris has shown no evidence of mechanical failure. </P> <P> A preliminary report confirmed that the plane's pilot who reported that the plane had suddenly gained altitude as he came in then went into a dive had been flying on manual as he claimed. </P> <P> The pilot had complained of technical problems but the report said that none had been discovered so far. </P> <P> The full investigation and analysis will continue many months. </P>,Romania,France,0.001553214, , ,

APW_ENG_19941116.0396,10/21/2006, <P> Wales suffered the most humiliating soccer defeat in its history Wednesday losing 5-0 to first-time entrant Georgia in qualifying for the 1996 European Championship. </P> <P> The loss coupled with a 3-2 defeat last month in another former Soviet republic Moldova all but closed the door on Welsh hopes for qualifying for the finals. Though it's still early in the tournament Wales must play four of its seven remaining games against group favorites Germany and Bulgaria. </P> <P> ``The players and myself are ashamed '' Wales manager Mike Smith said. ``We should have done a lot better than that. How can I sum up a game like that? They were far better than us.'' </P> <P> In numerical terms it was Wales' biggest defeat since a 6-1 loss to France in 1953. Georgia which is playing in the Europeans for the first time since gaining independence scored its first goals and earned its first points in the competition. The team previously lost to Moldova and Bulgaria. </P> <P> Although Smith could not call upon Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs who missed the game through injury his strikeforce had another United star Mark Hughes as well as Liverpool's Ian Rush and Dean Saunders of Aston Villa some of Europe's most feared strikers. </P> <P> But it was the Welsh defense that was repeatedly torn apart by Georgia's swift forwards. Temoliz Ketsbaia netted twice and other goals came from Georgi Kinkladze Gocha Gogrichiani and Shota Arveladze in front of the joyous 25 000 fans at Dynamo Stadium in Tbilisi. </P> <P> Also in Group 7 Germany opened its qualifying campaign with a 2-1 victory over Albania in front of a sellout crowd of 23 000 in Tirana. Strikers Juergen Klinsmann and Ulf Kirsten scored for Germany which has never lost to the Balkan country in nine meetings. </P> <P> Hysen Zmijani netted for Albania and Ledio Pano nearly tied it in the dying seconds when his free kick hit the post. The Albanians have lost both their qualifying matches. </P> <P> World Cup semifinalist Bulgaria moved into first place in the group beating Moldova 4-1 on two goals from Barcelona forward Hristo Stoichkov. </P> <P> A total of 36 teams were in action Wednesday in the eight qualifying groups. Defending champion Denmark visited Spain while World Cup finalist Italy hosted Croatia in later headline matches. In an exhibition game England hosted Nigeria at Wembley. </P> <P> At Zabrze Poland France played to a scoreless draw for the third time in three qualifying matches. </P> <P> Poland remained third in the group with four points in three matches. France moved up to fourth with three points in three games. </P> <P> In the rain at Trabzon Turkey Israel kept second place after goals from Ronen Harazi in the 30th minute and Ronnie Rosenthal in the 51st. Israel has six points from three games one point behind idle Romania. Azerbaijan has lost its three matches and has yet to score. </P> <P> European governing body UEFA ordered the match played at a neutral site because of civil unrest in the former Soviet republic. Some 5 000 Azeri fans made the trip. </P> <P> Ketsbaia scored in 30th and 49th minutes Kinkladze in the 39th Gogrichiani in the 59th and Arveladze in the 66th. </P> <P> Klinsmann struck in the 18th minute Zmijani equalized for Albania in the 33rd and Kirsten scored the winner in the 46th. </P> <P> In a battle for first place before 40 000 at Sofia Stoichkov scored in the 45th and 85th minutes Krasimir Balakov in the 64th and substitute Emil Kostadinov in the 87th for Bulgaria. Sergiu Cleschenco scored for Moldova in the 59th. </P> <P> Bulgaria moved into the group lead with a perfect tally of six points from two games. Moldova with two victories and a loss fell to second place on goal differential. </P> <P> Before 2 420 at Helsinki Finland won its first game and scored its first goals in the tournament against the perennial strugglers from the North Atlantic. Ajax Amsterdam striker Jari Litmanen and Mika-Matti Paatelainen of English club Bolton scored two goals each after Antti Sumiala's opening score. </P> <P> Finland has three points in three games while the Faeroes have lost all three matches allowing 15 goals and scoring just two. </P>,Romania,Albania; Spain; Azerbaijan; Turkey; Finland; Denmark; Poland; Italy; Georgia; Israel; Bulgaria; France; Nigeria; Germany; Croatia,0.000425897, , , 
APW_ENG_19941116.0399,4/26/2006, <P> France and Poland played to a scoreless draw in a European Championship qualifier on Wednesday a pouring rain preventing the French from capitalizing on superior speed and technical skills. </P> <P> It was the third goalless tie for France after draws with Slovakia and Romania in Group One matches. </P> <P> The Poles offered tough resistance on the muddy field near Katowice prompting plenty of foul play by frustrated Frenchmen. </P> <P> The referee sent Christian Karembeu off the field with a red card in the 49th minute after he brought down Poland's charging striker Roman Kosecki. </P> <P> A colorless first half saw few shots on goal although French striker Nicolas Ouedec made several skilled charges one ending in a narrow miss from the right-hand side of the penalty box. </P> <P> Poland's best opportunity came in the 13th minute when Kosecki took a pass 15 meters (45 feet) away only to sail a powerful shot over the bar. </P> <P> Marek Kozminski also made several dangerous charges on the French goal from the left wing but had to be carried off the field in the 29th minute after a foul by Karembeu. </P> <P> The French had more chances in the second half but goalie Jozef Wandzik equaled the challenge showing off his best on a 16-meter (48 feet) shot from midfielder Youri Djorkaeff. </P> <P> Poland gained steam in the waning minutes with Krzysztof Warzycha narrowly missing a header at 72 minutes. Striker Andrzej Juskowiak dribbled past two French defenders in the final minute and passed to Warzycha who failed under pressure to find a way to the net. </P> <P> Lineups: </P> <P> France: Bernard Lama - Jocelyn Angloma Laurent Blanc Eric Di Meco Alain Roche Marcel Desailly Christian Karembeu Paul Le Guen Eric Cantona Nicolas Ouedec (76th Christophe Dugary) Reynald Pedros (28th Youri Djorkaeff). </P> <P> Poland: Jozef Wandzik - Waldemar Jaskulski Marek Swierczewski Marek Kozminski (29th Jacek Bak) Tomasz Waldoch Sylwester Czereszewski Piotr Swierczewski Henryk Baluszynski Andrzej Juskowiak Roman Kosecki Krzysztof Warzycha. </P> <P> Booked - 27th Karembeu 37th Angloma </P> <P> Sent off - 49th Karembeu. </P> <P> Referee - Angelo Amendolia Italy </P> <P> Attendance - 18 000 </P>,Romania,Poland; Slovakia; France,0.011520384, , , 
APW_ENG_19941116.0405,8/26/2006, <P> International efforts bringing the Croatian government and rebel Serbs closer together showed signs of progress early Wednesday when the two sides reached tentative agreement on economic cooperation. </P> <P> ``This is a significant step forward in the peace process '' U.S. Ambassador Peter Galbraith said after more than 11 hours of negotiations. </P> <P> The agreement which would effectively rebuild war-shattered economic ties still has to be signed following its review by leaders of the respective sides. </P> <P> An economic agreement could anchor international efforts to reach a political settlement in Croatia where rebel Serbs hold one-third of Croatian territory which they captured in a six-month war in 1991. </P> <P> But previous efforts have repeatedly broken down over seemingly irreconcileable differences. The Serbs who have proclaimed their own state on the territory they control refuse to submit to Croatian government authority. The Croatian government has threatened to retake the Serb-held territories by force if necessary. </P> <P> U.N. resolutions and the United States insist on the territorial integrity of Croatia and the eventual reintegration of Serb-held territories. </P> <P> The agreement to be implemented one month after it is signed by both parties would restore water and electricity to a dozen communities and reopen oil pipelines. It would also reopen the highway linking the Croatian capital Zagreb with Belgrade capital of Serbia and what remains of Yugoslavia. </P> <P> Diplomats maintain that reestablishing economic links could facilitate future negotiations on an overall political settlement. </P> <P> ``The agreement requires good will on both sides '' Galbraith said. ``But we have to expect that each side sees it as earnest... in order to escape hostilities in which both sides would be losers.'' </P> <P> Galbraith is a member of an international mediating team that also includes Russian Ambassador Leonid Kerestedijanc and European Union negotiators Kai Eide and Geert Ahrens. </P> <P> The head of the Serb delegation Borislav Mikelic insisted that there be no political references whatsoever in the economic agreement. That he said was the condition for Serbs to sign. The agreement is to be reviewed by the Serbs' self-style parliament. </P> <P> Hrvoje Sarinic Croatia's head negotiator said Croatia would probably sign the agreement next week but emphasized it must be understood in the context of U.N. resolutions on Croatian sovereignty. </P> <P> Diplomatic sources indicated however that the Croatian government may be willing to drop its previous insistence that reference to such U.N. resolutions be made in any accord signed. That would open the door to Serb agreement. </P>,Serbia,Croatia,0.002332754, , ,

APW_ENG_19941116.0423,2/16/2006, <P> CHICAGO (AP) - Wheat futures prices tumbled to 11-week lows Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid a murky export picture. Corn and soybeans futures prices also sank. </P> <P> Wheat futures prices have been steadily losing ground in recent days as the Agriculture Department remains silent about new tenders for the crop. A widely anticipated announcement of new subsidies for Egypt has not materialized making some traders believe Egypt may look elsewhere. </P> <P> China also is said to be seeking wheat and an announcement to that effect could help maintain wheat through a key psychological support level Thursday said Steve Freed director of research for ADM Investor Services Inc. </P> <P> Corn futures closed mostly lower with the nearby contract ending unchanged on South Korean buying and news that Spain also is on the market for the crop. </P> <P> Soybeans futures closed moderately lower amid some profit-taking from recent strong gains. Strong overseas demand for vegetable oils has pushed soybean oil futures prices higher and taken soybeans futures with them. Traders became nervous Wednesday that the gains were excessive. </P> <P> Prices also were pressured by rain in northern Brazil which is relieving water-starved crops there. </P> <P> Wheat for December delivery fell 4 1-2 cents to dlrs 3.73 3-4 a bushel; December corn was unchanged at dlrs 2.16 3-4 a bushel; December oats were 1 3-4 cents lower at dlrs 1.23 1-2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 1 1-2 cents to dlrs 5.58 3-4 a bushel. </P>,China,Egypt; Brazil; Spain,0.00503755, , ,

APW_ENG_19941116.0431,12/3/2006, <P> Toyota expects to sell up to 50 000 of the Japanese automaker's new Kentucky-built Avalon sedans in this country next year without hurting sales of the Camry sedan on which it was based. </P> <P> ``We basically consider it as additional volume '' Toyota Motor Sales vice president Robert D. Weldon said Tuesday at a Detroit preview of the Avalon and the 1995 Tercel subcompact. </P> <P> An additional 14 000 Avalons will be exported to Japan Taiwan Puerto Rico Canada and the Middle East. ``At this point in time Europe is not on the export list '' Weldon said. </P> <P> The Avalon was designed for the U.S. market and is being built at the company's Georgetown Ky. plant which recently underwent an dlrs 800 million expansion. Shipments to dealers began last week. </P> <P> Classified as a full-size car based on interior passenger space the Avalon is aimed at buyers who are moving up from sedans such as Toyota's Camry Honda Accord Nissan Maxima and Mazda 626 Weldon said. Other comparable cars might be Chrysler Corp.'s LH sedans and Buick LeSabre. </P> <P> ``But our buyer for the Avalon is going to be an import-oriented type buyer '' Weldon said. </P> <P> Based on the Camry platform the Avalon is 4 inches longer 24 pounds heavier and can be equipped with a front bench seat so it can carry six people. Prices range from about dlrs 23 000 to dlrs 30 000. </P> <P> Weldon said he expects one group of buyers will be the devotees of the Cressida Toyota's flagship sedan that was phased out after the 1991 model year. </P> <P> Robert C. Maling Jr. another Toyota Motor Sales vice president said the company expects to sell about 80 000 Tercels in 1995. The car comes in two-door and four-door versions. Prices start at about dlrs 10 000. </P> <P> Weldon said calendar-year sales of Toyotas in the United States probably will surpass 1 million for the first time this year not counting Toyota's luxury Lexus line. </P> <P> About half the Toyotas sold here are built in North America. By 1997 the company expects to be able to build 900 000 vehicles a year in North America. </P>,Canada,Japan,0.003034691, , ,

APW_ENG_19941116.0438,2/24/2006, <P> Army Sgt. Fred Cain wouldn't have left Panama without his adopted 2-year-old son Cameron. Now thanks to a last-minute humanitarian parole he can bring Cameron with the rest of his family to his new posting in Florida. </P> <P> Cain and his wife Sandy spent 18 months trying to adopt the Panamanian boy who has been living with them since he was 6 months old. The adoption was completed Oct. 10. </P> <P> The next day the Cains found out a new immigration rule imposed a two-year waiting period before their son could get a visa to enter the United States. But Cain was due for transfer to Florida on Nov. 21. </P> <P> ``I never would have left him here -- I wouldn't allow that to happen '' Cain a Brockton Mass. native said Wednesday from Panama. He would have sought another extension of his Panama duty he said. </P> <P> But happily the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service approved the humanitarian waiver last week. The family plans to fly to South Carolina on Monday and spend the Thanksgiving holiday next week with family in Brockton. </P> <P> The Cains have two biological and two adopted children. </P> <P> Cain still doesn't know why the INS made it so difficult for him to bring his son to the United States. </P> <P> The new rule concerns countries such as Panama and Romania that do not distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate births. As of Oct. 1 the United States considers all births in those countries to be legitimate meaning both parents can be accounted for. </P> <P> But that means Americans trying to adopt babies from those countries must get approval from both parents or proof that one or both of the parents have died or abandoned the child. Often in reality no one knows who both the parents are. </P> <P> Cameron's natural mother is a poor Panamanian Indian who gave the Cains permission to adopt her son but didn't know where his father was. </P> <P> Cain gave his sister Eileen Cain of Brockton the credit for hounding the INS and the State Department on the family's behalf. </P> <P> ``She's not obnoxious or anything but she doesn't take no for an answer '' he said laughing. </P> <P> Eileen said the humanitarian parole came through after she crashed a breakfast party at Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's campaign headquarters Nov. 9 the day after he won re-election. </P> <P> ``I handed to his wife Vicki who was awesome to me all the (newspaper) articles ... a letter begging for his help asking him to contact the head of INS on our behalf '' she said. ``I was crying and she was hugging me and I said `Help me and my family.''' </P> <P> Although earlier in the day INS officials had told her it would be weeks before they could make a decision on the humanitarian parole they called back that afternoon and told her it had been granted she said. </P> <P> The Cains still want the rule changed however. </P> <P> ``I think of the parents who are in the (United) States trying to adopt and their child has to stay in foster care for two years before they can bring them home '' Sandy Cain said. </P> <P> Eileen Cain is giving those other parents many of whom have called her some advice: </P> <P> ``Kick up a storm and make them figure out what they're going to do about this regulation that's tearing up these families '' she said. ``Children will die because nobody will go through the expense to adopt a poor child.'' </P>,Romania,Panama,0.200000003,-0.200000003,0.002064096,
